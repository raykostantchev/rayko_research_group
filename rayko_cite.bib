abstract = {Using a spatially structured, optical pump pulse with a terahertz (THz) probe pulse, we are able to determine spatial variations of the ultrafast THz photoconductivity with subwavelength resolution (75 $\mu$m ≈ $\lambda$/5 at 0.8 THz) in a planar graphene sample. We compare our results to Raman spectroscopy and correlate the existence of the spatial inhomogeneities between the two measurements. We find a strong correlation with inhomogeneity in electron density. This demonstrates the importance of eliminating inhomogeneities in doping density during CVD growth and fabrication for photoconductive devices. T he unique optoelectronic properties of graphene have received a lot of attention. 1 For example, ultrafast carrier relaxation, 2−6 highly tunable doping levels, 7 theoretical mobilities in excess of 150 000 cm 2 V −1 s −1 , 7 and high thermal conductivity 8 all lend themselves to a number of interesting device applications. However, the large scale manufacturing of this 2D material, usually through chemical vapor deposition (CVD), is not yet perfected, and it is well-established that there are a number of sources of quality degrading, spatial inhomogeneities such as charge puddles, grain boundaries, substrate-induced strain variations, surface impurities, periodic nanoripples, multilayer nucleation sites, and fabrication residues. 9−13 Raman spectroscopy and imaging has emerged as an important characterization tool, due to its sensitivity to layer number, 14 strain, 12 carrier concentration, 15 and de-fects. 16−19 However, the photoconductivity, a critical quantity for many optoelectronic applications including photodetec-tors, 20,21 cannot be explicitly determined directly in Raman due to the limited number of observable quantities. Given its relevance to many optoelectronic applications of graphene, evaluation of the ultrafast photoconductivity from optical-pump THz-probe spectroscopy has attracted consid-erable interest in the literature in recent years. However, a consensus is yet to be reached regarding the origin and nature of the ultrafast photoconductive response of graphene, with a number of recent papers 22−29 contributing to the debate. These contain a number of competing descriptions, each explaining some of the observed features as arising from a competition between stimulated emission and induced absorption, 22 or through a competition between photoinduced changes in the chemical potential, mobility, and carrier relaxation described using thermodynamic, 23,24 a modified Drude, 25,26 or micro-scopic 27 models. Some very recent work 28,29 suggests that plasmon emission may also contribute. Despite all of this work, the role of spatial inhomogeneities has not been discussed in literature to date: due to the large THz spot sizes (≈ mm) used in these experiments, they typically provide spatially averaged information and are therefore ignorant of the small spatial inhomogeneities typical in CVD graphene. In this study, we introduce a technique able to directly image how these spatial inhomogeneities affect the local, photo-conductive THz response of graphene. This is achieved via spatial patterning of the optical pump beam, allowing us to selectively sample our graphene, and thereby building a THz photoconductivity map of our CVD graphene sample (supplied by graphenesupermarket.com using a CVD copper growth technique 30 and PMMA assisted transfer 31,32). We compare the spatially dependent THz photoconductivity to Raman spectral maps and find there to be various correlated features. We find that small regions of graphene with low electron density display a strongly suppressed photoconductivity on ultrafast time scales. Since the resolution of our measurement is determined by the patterned optical pump pulse, we are able to observe these small regions of suppressed THz photoconductivity on markedly subwavelength length scales (75 $\mu$m ≈ $\lambda$/5 at 0.8 THz). We use an amplified femtosecond laser system (800 nm, 1 kHz repetition rate, ∼100 fs) to generate and detect our THz probe beam in a pair of ZnTe crystals through optical rectification 33 and balanced electro-optic sampling, 33 respec-tively. This allows us to determine the electric field, E, of a single cycle THz pulse (central frequency ∼0.8 THz, fwhm},

Our results show that the measured temporal waveform and frequency spectra are distinctly changed due to the presence of the particles, thereby confirming the effectiveness of this method for detecting defects.

However, it is relatively under-utilized for terahertz spectroscopy. The major technique reported uses wavelet denoising in the time-domain, which has a fuzzy physical meaning and limited performance in low-frequency and water-vapor regions. Here, we work from a new perspective by reconstructing the transfer function to remove noise-induced oscillations. The method is fully objective without a need for defining a threshold. Both reflection imaging and transmission imaging were conducted. The experimental results show that both low- and high-frequency noise and the water-vapor influence were efficiently removed. The spectrum accuracy was also improved, and the image contrast was significantly enhanced. The signal-to-noise ratio of the leaf image was increased up to 10 dB, with the 6 dB bandwidth being extended by over 0.5 THz.},

However, due to the long wavelengths employed ($\lambda$ = 300 $\mu$m at 1THz), diffraction limited imaging is typically restricted to spatial resolutions around a millimeter. Here, we demonstrate a new form of subwavelength hyperspectral, polarization-resolved THz imaging which employs an optical pattern projected onto a 6 $\mu$m-thin silicon wafer to achieve near-field modulation of a co-incident THz pulse. By placing near-field scatterers, one can measure the interaction of object with the evanescent THz fields. Further, by measuring the temporal evolution of the THz field a sample's permittivity can be extracted with 65 $\mu$m spatial resolution due to the presence of evanescent fields. Here, we present the first application of this new approach to articular cartilage. We show that the THz permittivity in this material varies progressively from the superficial zone to the deep layer, and that this correlates with a change in orientation of the collagen fibrils that compose the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the tissue. Our approach enables direct interrogation of the sample's biophysical properties, in this case concerning the structure and permittivity of collagen fibrils and their anisotropic organisation in connective tissue.},

The Brewster angle of the device can be tuned by varying the conductivity of the graphene through an electrical gate. In this way, we achieve near perfect intensity modulation with spectrally flat modulation depth of 99.3 to 99.9 percent and phase tunability of up to 140 degree in the frequency range from 0.5 to 1.6 THz. Different from using electromagnetic resonance effects (for example, metamaterials), this principle ensures that our device can operate in ultra-broadband.

abstract = {Terahertz imaging looks set to become an integral part of future applications from semiconductor quality control to medical diagnosis. This will only become a reality when the technology is sufficiently cheap and capabilities adequate to compete with others. Single-pixel cameras use a spatial light modulator and a detector with no spatial-resolution in their imaging process. The spatial-modulator is key as it imparts a series of encoding masks on the beam and the detector measures the dot product of each mask and the object, thereby allowing computers to recover an image via post-processing. They are inherently slower than parallel-pixel imaging arrays although they are more robust and cheaper, hence are highly applicable to the terahertz regime. This chapter dedicates itself to terahertz single-pixel cameras; their current implementations, future directions and how they compare to other terahertz imaging techniques. We start by outlining the competing imaging techniques, then we discuss the theory behind single-pixel imaging; the main section shows the methods of spatially modulating a terahertz beam; and finally there is a discussion about the future limits of such cameras and the concluding remarks express the authors' vision for the future of single-pixel THz cameras.},

Occluding the skin causes water to accumulate in the top layer of the skin (the stratum corneum [SC]) and also affects the water diffusivity. Scar treatments such as silicone gel and silicone sheets make use of occlusion to increase skin hydration. However with existing techniques, it is not possible to quantitatively measure the diffusivity of the water during occlusion: current methods determine water diffusivity by measuring the water evaporated through the skin and thus require the skin to breathe. In this work, we use the high sensitivity of terahertz light to water to study how the water content in the SC changes upon occlusion. From our measurements, we can solve the diffusion equations in the SC to deduce the water concentration profile in occluded skin and subsequently to determine the diffusivity. To our knowledge, this is the first work showing how the diffusivity of human skin can be measured during occlusion and we envisage this paper as being used as a guide for non-invasively determining the diffusivity of occluded human skin in vivo.},

abstract = {Single pixel imaging (SPI) captures images without array detectors or raster scanning. When combined with compressive sensing techniques it enables novel solutions for high-speed optical imaging and spectroscopy. However, when it comes to the real-time capture and analysis of a fast event, the challenge is the inherent trade-off between frame rate and image resolution. Due to the lack of sufficient sparsity and the intrinsic iterative process, conventional compressed sensing techniques have limited improvement in capturing natural scenes and displaying the images in real time. In this work, we demonstrate a novel alternative compressive imaging approach employing an efficient and easy-implementation sampling scheme based on reordering the deterministic Hadamard basis through their total variation. By this means, the number of measurements and acquisition are reduced significantly without needing complex minimization algorithms. We can recover a 128 × 128 image with a sampling ratio of 5% at the signal peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 23.8 dB, achieving super sub-Nyquist sampling SPI. Compared to other widely used sampling e.g. standard Hadamard protocols and Gaussian matrix methods, this approach results in a significant improvement both in the compression ratio and image reconstruction quality, enabling SPI for high frame rate imaging or video applications.},

abstract = {The terehertz radiation potentially has many interesting applications. From air port security, non-destructive evaluations of electronics and space shuttle panels, to non-ionizing photon energies with the potential to detect cancer growths and quality control of pharmaceutical tables, the list of potential applications is vast as shown in chapter 1. However, there is a lack of cheap, robust and efficient THz sources, detectors and modulators. Further, the long wavelengths render micron sized details unseeable with far-field imaging techniques. This has rendered most imaging applications unusable in the real world. This thesis is based around demonstrating an imaging technique that uses a near-field THz modulator to obtain sub-wavelength images. There are five distinct experimental demonstrations that show the full capacity of the imaging technique developed here. Chapter 2 gives an outline of the background physics knowledge needed to understand the entirety of the thesis. An outline of the mathematics used for modellingis given in the latter part of the chapter as well. Chapter 3 gives a background on the THz generation and detection techniques used in our THz-TDS system, optical rectification and electro-optic sampling in ZnTe. Further more, our system is capable of photoexciting a sample in conjunction to it being probed with a THz pulse. For the most part, we photoexcite a silicon wafer in order to use its photoconductive properties to modulate our THz pulse. Our photoexcitation pulse is spatially modulated, via a digital micromirror device, which in turn spatially modulates our THz pulse. This patterned THz pulse can then be used with a single-element detector to perform imaging. How to do this and the type of patterns needed is described in the latter part of chapter 3. Chapter 4 is the first demonstration that photo-induced conductivity in silicon can be used to manipulate evanescent THz fields for sub-wavelength imaging. For this, we imaged a 1D sub-wavelength slit and were able to obtain the slit profile with 65$\mu$m ($\lambda$/6 at 0.75T Hz) resolution. Chapter 5 demonstrates what limits the resolution in our imaging system. Namely, the distance which the patterned THz pulse propagates to the object from where itwas spatially modulated. We demonstrate 9$\mu$m ($\lambda$/45 at 0.75T Hz) resolution using an ultra-thin (6$\mu$m) silicon wafer. At such sub-wavelength scales polarization becomes an important factor. We show how one can use polarization in order to detect 8$\mu$m breaks in a circuit board hidden by 115$\mu$m of silicon. Chapter 6 concerns itself with showing how noise affects our images. Further more, our imaging system is compatible with compressed sensing where one can obtain an image using fewer measurements than the number of pixels. We investigate how different under-sampling techniques perform in our system. Note under-sampling at sub-wavelength resolutions, as is done here, is rather unusual and is of yet to be demonstrated for other part of the electro-magnetic spectrum. Chapter 7 shows that one does not need to photoexcite silicon. One can in principle illuminate any material, hence we photoexcite graphene with our spatially modulated optical pulses. This allows us to obtain the THz photoconductive response of our graphene sample with sub-wavelength resolution (75$\mu$m ≈ $\lambda$/5 at 0.75T Hz). We compare our results with Raman spectra maps. We find a clear correlation between THz photoconductivity and carrier concentration (extracted from Raman). Chapter 8 exploits the full capacity of our imaging system by performing hyper-spectral near-field THz imaging on a biological sample. For this, in our imaged field of view, we measured the full temporal trace of our THz pulse at a sub-wavelength spatial resolution. This has allowed us to extract the frequency dependent permittivity of our biological sample, articular cartilage, over our spectral range (0.2-2T Hz). We find the permittivity to change on a sub-wavelength scale in correlation with changes in the structure of our sample. However, the permittivity extraction procedures that have been developed make a far-field approximation. We mathematically show the presence of the THz near-fields to render the long wavelength spectral parts of our extracted permittivity to be wrong. Chapter 9 is where we conclude and point out the main problem that needs to be addressed in order to make the measurements presented here more accessible to others. Namely, the cost of the laser system powering the THz-TDS and how to further reduce the acquisition time.},

We theoretically deduce a formula about the relation between plasma frequency and characteristic surface plasmon frequency. The characteristic surface plasmon frequency can be captured from the cut-off frequency of the transmission spectra of the broadband surface plasmon, which is used to measure the plasma frequency indirectly. The plasma frequencies of an intrinsic indium antimonide with and without optical illuminance are measured with a THz time-domain spectrometer at room temperature. The experimental measured plasma frequencies fit well with theoretical and simulation results. Compared with other methods, the proposed method has a special advantage on measuring the plasma frequency for a thin semiconductor film coated on other materials.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).Optical modulation of terahertz surface plasmon polaritons (THz SPPs) propagating in an intrinsic indium antimonide surface is demonstrated in this paper. The modulation is mediated by the modification of free carrier density with optical illumination. Simulation and experimental results show that a THz modulator can be realized by tuning the propagation lengths of THz SPPs, which could be controlled to be larger or shorter than the distance of two razor blades used for the coupling of the THz wave and the THz SPPs. In comparison with conventional THz modulation approaches, this method of manufacturing is simpler and the switching bandwidth is wider. The maximum modulation frequency of the modulators is anticipated to be above gigahertz, thus leading to the possibility of communication applications using the THz baseband.},

abstract = {Terahertz (THz) radiation is poised to have an essential role in many imaging applications, from industrial inspections to medical diagnosis. However, commercialization is prevented by impractical and expensive THz instrumentation. Single-pixel cameras have emerged as alternatives to multi-pixel cameras due to reduced costs and superior durability. Here, by optimizing the modulation geometry and post-processing algorithms, we demonstrate the acquisition of a THz-video (32 × 32 pixels at 6 frames-per-second), shown in real-time, using a single-pixel fiber-coupled photoconductive THz detector. A laser diode with a digital micromirror device shining visible light onto silicon acts as the spatial THz modulator. We mathematically account for the temporal response of the system, reduce noise with a lock-in free carrier-wave modulation and realize quick, noise-robust image undersampling. Since our modifications do not impose intricate manufacturing, require long post-processing, nor sacrifice the time-resolving capabilities of THz-spectrometers, their greatest asset, this work has the potential to serve as a foundation for all future single-pixel THz imaging systems.},

abstract = {Terahertz (THz) imaging can see through otherwise opaque materials. However, because of the long wavelengths of THz radiation ($\lambda$ = 400 $\mu$m at 0.75 THz), far-field THz imaging techniques suffer from low resolution compared to visible wavelengths. We demonstrate noninvasive, near-field THz imaging with subwavelength resolution. We project a time-varying, intense ( > 100 $\mu$J/cm(2)) optical pattern onto a silicon wafer, which spatially modulates the transmission of synchronous pulse of THz radiation. An unknown object is placed on the hidden side of the silicon, and the far-field THz transmission corresponding to each mask is recorded by a single-element detector. Knowledge of the patterns and of the corresponding detector signal are combined to give an image of the object. Using this technique, we image a printed circuit board on the underside of a 115-$\mu$m-thick silicon wafer with $\sim$100-$\mu$m ($\lambda$/4) resolution. With subwavelength resolution and the inherent sensitivity to local conductivity, it is possible to detect fissures in the circuitry wiring of a few micrometers in size. THz imaging systems of this type will have other uses too, where noninvasive measurement or imaging of concealed structures is necessary, such as in semiconductor manufacturing or in ex vivo bioimaging.},
