Abstract = {We present measurements and analytical modeling which demonstrate
   enhanced THz transmission through a subwavelength aperture via
   light-induced diffraction. Our experiment involves photoexciting a
   conducting pattern onto a silicon interface so as to control and
   modulate the near-field interference of THz radiation. To illustrate the
   concept, we photoexcite a simple double-conducting stripe pattern on the
   incident side of a silicon wafer which has a slit etched into a gold
   film on the exit side. We show that under certain resonant conditions
   set by the stripe dimensions, a constructive near-field interference can
   bring about enhanced transmission through the slit. By raster scanning
   the excitation pattern under these resonant conditions, one can build an
   image of subwavelength features such as the slit aperture of our sample.},

Abstract = {We propose a new method for detecting small defects on the surface of a
   semiconductor by analyzing the transmission spectrum of terahertz
   surface plasmon polaritons. The field distributions caused by the
   detection of defects of different sizes are simulated. Experimentally,
   using a terahertz time domain spectrometer, we measure the transmission
   spectrum of terahertz surface plasmon polaritons passing through
   particles on the surface of an intrinsic InSb wafer. Our results show
   that the measured temporal waveform and frequency spectra are distinctly
   changed due to the presence of the particles, thereby confirming the
   effectiveness of this method for detecting defects. For increased
   detection efficiency, the frequency of the surface plasmon polaritons
   has to be slightly lower than the plasma frequency of the semiconductor.
   In comparison with traditional methods, our approach offers the merits
   of detecting both on-surface and subsurface defects, which is critical
   in monitoring the quality of semiconductor wafers. (C) 2016 Optical

Abstract = {Terahertz (THz) imaging can see through otherwise opaque materials.
   However, because of the long wavelengths of THz radiation (lambda = 400
   mu m at 0.75 THz), far-field THz imaging techniques suffer from low
   resolution compared to visible wavelengths. We demonstrate noninvasive,
   near-field THz imaging with subwavelength resolution. We project a
   time-varying, intense (>100 mu J/cm(2)) optical pattern onto a silicon
   wafer, which spatially modulates the transmission of synchronous pulse
   of THz radiation. An unknown object is placed on the hidden side of the
   silicon, and the far-field THz transmission corresponding to each mask
   is recorded by a single-element detector. Knowledge of the patterns and
   of the corresponding detector signal are combined to give an image of
   the object. Using this technique, we image a printed circuit board on
   the underside of a 115-mu m-thick silicon wafer with similar to 100-mu m
   (lambda/4) resolution. With subwavelength resolution and the inherent
   sensitivity to local conductivity, it is possible to detect fissures in
   the circuitry wiring of a few micrometers in size. THz imaging systems
   of this type will have other uses too, where noninvasive measurement or
   imaging of concealed structures is necessary, such as in semiconductor
   manufacturing or in ex vivo bioimaging.},

Journal = {Optical Engineering},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Optical modulation of terahertz surface plasmon polaritons (THz SPPs)
   propagating in an intrinsic indium antimonide surface is demonstrated in
   this paper. The modulation is mediated by the modification of free
   carrier density with optical illumination. Simulation and experimental
   results show that a THz modulator can be realized by tuning the
   propagation lengths of THz SPPs, which could be controlled to be larger
   or shorter than the distance of two razor blades used for the coupling
   of the THz wave and the THz SPPs. In comparison with conventional THz
   modulation approaches, this method of manufacturing is simpler and the
   switching bandwidth is wider. The maximum modulation frequency of the
   modulators is anticipated to be above gigahertz, thus leading to the
   possibility of communication applications using the THz baseband. (C)

Abstract = {Measurement of the plasma frequency of a semiconductor film using
   broadband surface plasmon is demonstrated in this paper. We
   theoretically deduce a formula about the relation between plasma
   frequency and characteristic surface plasmon frequency. The
   characteristic surface plasmon frequency can be captured from the
   cut-off frequency of the transmission spectra of the broadband surface
   plasmon, which is used to measure the plasma frequency indirectly. The
   plasma frequencies of an intrinsic indium antimonide with and without
   optical illuminance are measured with a THz time-domain spectrometer at
   room temperature. The experimental measured plasma frequencies fit well
   with theoretical and simulation results. Compared with other methods,
   the proposed method has a special advantage on measuring the plasma
   frequency for a thin semiconductor film coated on other materials. (C)

Title = {Subwavelength hyperspectral THz studies of articular cartilage},
Journal = {Scientific Reports},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},
Month = {MAY 2},
Abstract = {Terahertz-spectroscopy probes dynamics and spectral response of
   collective vibrational modes in condensed phase, which can yield insight
   into composition and topology. However, due to the long wavelengths
   employed (lambda = 300 mu m at 1THz), diffraction limited imaging is
   typically restricted to spatial resolutions around a millimeter. Here,
   we demonstrate a new form of subwavelength hyperspectral,
   polarization-resolved THz imaging which employs an optical pattern
   projected onto a 6 mu m-thin silicon wafer to achieve near-field
   modulation of a co-incident THz pulse. By placing near-field scatterers,
   one can measure the interaction of object with the evanescent THz
   fields. Further, by measuring the temporal evolution of the THz field a
   sample's permittivity can be extracted with 65 mu m spatial resolution
   due to the presence of evanescent fields. Here, we present the first
   application of this new approach to articular cartilage. We show that
   the THz permittivity in this material varies progressively from the
   superficial zone to the deep layer, and that this correlates with a
   change in orientation of the collagen fibrils that compose the
   extracellular matrix (ECM) of the tissue. Our approach enables direct
   interrogation of the sample's biophysical properties, in this case
   concerning the structure and permittivity of collagen fibrils and their
   anisotropic organisation in connective tissue.},

   illumination, the 1 THz phonon modes of encapsulated films slowly
   reduced in strength, whereas in films exposed to moisture and oxygen,
   these phonons weaken more rapidly and blue-shift in frequency. The rapid

  abstract={Subwavelength perovskite thin films can only cause less than a 10% intensity reduction of the transmitted terahertz (THz) signal; this small dynamic range makes it difficult to track minor changes in the phonon modes. We propose a THz thin film total internal reflection (TF-TIR) spectroscopy technique to characterize photo-induced spectral changes of MAPbI3, MAPbI2.5Br0.5, MAPbI2Br1 and MAPbBr3. Our approach enhanced the THz responsivity of the perovskites thin films by a factor of 4 compared to THz transmission spectroscopy. The light induced the strength of the phonon modes at around 2 THz to increase after 5 min of illumination, corresponding to the enhanced stretching of the lead halide bond. After 10 min, the strength of the phonon modes at around 1 THz started to decrease, corresponding to the weakened bending of the lead halide bond. Blue shifts were observed on the resonant frequencies apart from MAPbBr3. By comparing the results of four perovskites, we conclude the perovskites that have higher iodide ratio are more unstable in the presence of light and moisture. With the support of X-ray diffraction measurements, we suggest that THz TF-TIR spectroscopy provides distinct information of vibrational kinetics of lead-halide bond in perovskites.},

Abstract = {Terahertz modulators with high tunability of both intensity and phase
   are essential for effective control of electromagnetic properties. Due
   to the underlying physics behind existing approaches there is still a
   lack of broadband devices able to achieve deep modulation. Here, we
   demonstrate the effect of tunable Brewster angle controlled by graphene,
   and develop a highly-tunable solid-state graphene/quartz modulator based
   on this mechanism. The Brewster angle of the device can be tuned by
   varying the conductivity of the graphene through an electrical gate. In
   this way, we achieve near perfect intensity modulation with spectrally
   flat modulation depth of 99.3 to 99.9 percent and phase tunability of up
   to 140 degree in the frequency range from 0.5 to 1.6 THz. Different from
   using electromagnetic resonance effects (for example, metamaterials),
   this principle ensures that our device can operate in ultra-broadband.
   Thus it is an effective principle for terahertz modulation.},

Abstract = {We employed a metallic wire grating loaded with graphene and operating
   in total internal reflection (TIR) geometry to realize deep and
   broadband THz modulation. The non-resonant field enhancement effect of
   the evanescent wave in TIR geometry and in the subwavelength wire
   grating was combined to demonstrate a similar to 77\% modulation depth
   (MD) in the frequency range of 0.2-1.4 THz. This MD, achieved
   electrically with a SiO2/Si gated graphene device, was 4.5 times higher
   than that of the device without a metal grating in transmission
   geometry. By optimizing the parameters of the metallic wire grating, the
   required sheet conductivity of graphene for deep modulation was lowered
   to 0.87 mS. This work has potential applications in THz communication
   and real-time THz imaging. (C) 2018 Chinese Laser Press},

Abstract = {Terahertz (THz) light is non-ionizing and highly sensitive to subtle
   changes in water concentration which can be indicative of disease. The
   short THz penetration depth in bio-samples restricts in vivo
   measurements to be in a reflection geometry and the sample is often
   placed onto an imaging window. Upon contacting the imaging window,
   occlusion and compression of the skin affect the THz response. If not
   appropriately controlled, this could cause misleading results. In this
   work, we investigate and quantify how the applied pressure affects the
   THz response of skin and employ a stratified model to help understand
   the mechanisms at play. This work will enable future THz studies to have
   a more rigorous experimental protocol, which in turn will facilitate
   research in various potential biomedical applications under
   investigation. (C) 2018 Optical Society of America under the terms of

Journal = {Journal Of Biophotonics},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Water diffusion and the concentration profile within the skin
   significantly affect the surrounding chemical absorption and molecular
   synthesis. Occluding the skin causes water to accumulate in the top
   layer of the skin (the stratum corneum {[}SC]) and also affects the
   water diffusivity. Scar treatments such as silicone gel and silicone
   sheets make use of occlusion to increase skin hydration. However with
   existing techniques, it is not possible to quantitatively measure the
   diffusivity of the water during occlusion: current methods determine
   water diffusivity by measuring the water evaporated through the skin and
   thus require the skin to breathe. In this work, we use the high
   sensitivity of terahertz light to water to study how the water content
   in the SC changes upon occlusion. From our measurements, we can solve
   the diffusion equations in the SC to deduce the water concentration
   profile in occluded skin and subsequently to determine the diffusivity.
   To our knowledge, this is the first work showing how the diffusivity of
   human skin can be measured during occlusion and we envisage this paper
   as being used as a guide for non-invasively determining the diffusivity
   of occluded human skin in vivo.},

   hydrates the skin beneath it, with minimal lateral effects beyond the

Single-pixel detectors with spatial light modulation imaging techniques offer a path to rapid, cheap and no-moving parts imaging systems. Here, by imaging in this modality, where we use a photoconductive antenna and a THz spatial modulator based on tailoring a semiconductor's Drude plasma frequency by spatial photoexcitation, we optimize this process by considering the modulation geometry. Finally, by considering the system's temporal response in post-processing, we show that one can reach a mask modulation rate of 20kHz, only limited by the digital micromirror (DMD) switch speeds.},

Taking the measurement quickly has been a priority hitherto, but now that acquisition speeds are faster, we need to consider other aspects in more detail. Some key variables when measuring human skin in vivo include the contact pressure made with the THz probe and the duration of contact. In this talk I will present work by my group on THz spatial light modulators and other devices exploiting the total internal reflection geometry (TIR) which were developed to facilitate speeding up THz image acquisition and polarization control. I will explain how the TIR geometry of the THz modulator enhances sensitivity, and that this sensitivity can be useful for thin film material characterization.

The key message is that, while the choice of materials used in such devices is important, the geometry in which they are employed also has a significant effect on the performance achieved.

Abstract = {As an essential processing step in many disciplines, signal denoising efficiently improves data quality without extra cost. However, it is relatively under-utilized for terahertz spectroscopy. The major technique reported uses wavelet denoising in the time-domain, which has a fuzzy physical meaning and limited performance in low-frequency and water-vapor regions. Here, we work from a new perspective by reconstructing the transfer function to remove noise-induced oscillations. The method is fully objective without a need for defining a threshold. Both reflection imaging and transmission imaging were conducted. The experimental results show that both low- and high-frequency noise and the water-vapor influence were efficiently removed. The spectrum accuracy was also improved, and the image contrast was significantly enhanced. The signal-to-noise ratio of the leaf image was increased up to 10 dB, with the 6 dB bandwidth being extended by over 0.5 THz.},

Month = {MAY 21},
Abstract = {Terahertz (THz) radiation is poised to have an essential role in many
   imaging applications, from industrial inspections to medical diagnosis.
   However, commercialization is prevented by impractical and expensive THz
   instrumentation. Single-pixel cameras have emerged as alternatives to
   multi-pixel cameras due to reduced costs and superior durability. Here,
   by optimizing the modulation geometry and post-processing algorithms, we
   demonstrate the acquisition of a THz-video (32 x 32 pixels at 6
   frames-per-second), shown in real-time, using a single-pixel
   fiber-coupled photoconductive THz detector. A laser diode with a digital
   micromirror device shining visible light onto silicon acts as the
   spatial THz modulator. We mathematically account for the temporal
   response of the system, reduce noise with a lock-in free carrier-wave
   modulation and realize quick, noise-robust image undersampling. Since
   our modifications do not impose intricate manufacturing, require long
   post-processing, nor sacrifice the time-resolving capabilities of
   THz-spectrometers, their greatest asset, this work has the potential to
   serve as a foundation for all future single-pixel THz imaging systems.
   Terahertz imaging is promising in many applications, but still relies on
   complex equipment. Here, the authors develop a simplified solution that
   enables terahertz real-time imaging using a single-pixel detector and
   rapid reconstruction methods.},

   Ordering of the Hadamard Basis},
Journal = {Scientific Reports},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Month = {JUN 9},
Abstract = {Single pixel imaging (SPI) captures images without array detectors or
   raster scanning. When combined with compressive sensing techniques it
   enables novel solutions for high-speed optical imaging and spectroscopy.
   However, when it comes to the real-time capture and analysis of a fast
   event, the challenge is the inherent trade-off between frame rate and
   image resolution. Due to the lack of sufficient sparsity and the
   intrinsic iterative process, conventional compressed sensing techniques
   have limited improvement in capturing natural scenes and displaying the
   images in real time. In this work, we demonstrate a novel alternative
   compressive imaging approach employing an efficient and
   easy-implementation sampling scheme based on reordering the
   deterministic Hadamard basis through their total variation. By this
   means, the number of measurements and acquisition are reduced
   significantly without needing complex minimization algorithms. We can
   recover a 128x128 image with a sampling ratio of 5\% at the signal peak
   signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 23.8dB, achieving super sub-Nyquist
   sampling SPI. Compared to other widely used sampling e.g. standard
   Hadamard protocols and Gaussian matrix methods, this approach results in
   a significant improvement both in the compression ratio and image
   reconstruction quality, enabling SPI for high frame rate imaging or
   video applications.},

Abstract = {Potential applications of terahertz (THz) radiation are constantly being
   investigated for high-speed communication due to its large bandwidth.
   For example, frequency hopping communication technology would benefit
   from the large bandwidth. To attach the information to the carrier wave,
   THz modulators with deep and stable modulation at different frequencies
   are crucial, yet are still lacking. Here a THz modulator, designed by
   integrating a non-resonant field enhancement effect of periodic metal
   microslits to assist a Fabry-Perot resonance structure (MS-FP) is
   proposed and demonstrated. New equations are developed to describe the
   superior performance of the novel design. The >95\% modulation depth is
   achieved by a SiO2/Si gated graphene device at 14 Fabry-Perot resonant

Abstract = { Terahertz (THz) technology has experienced rapid development in the past two decades. Growing numbers of interdisciplinary applications are emerging, including materials science, physics, communications, and security as well as biomedicine. THz biophotonics involves studies applying THz photonic technology in biomedicine, which has attracted attention due to the unique features of THz waves, such as the high sensitivity to water, resonance with biomolecules, favorable spatial resolution, capacity to probe the water–biomolecule interactions, and nonionizing photon energy. Despite the great potential, THz biophotonics is still at an early stage of development. There is a lack of standards for instrumentation, measurement protocols, and data analysis, which makes it difficult to make comparisons among all the work published. In this article, we give a comprehensive review of the key findings that have underpinned research into biomedical applications of THz technology. In particular, we will focus on the advances made in general THz instrumentation and specific THz-based instruments for biomedical applications. We will also discuss the theories describing the interaction between THz light and biomedical samples. We aim to provide an overview of both basic biomedical research as well as pre-clinical and clinical applications under investigation. The paper aims to provide a clear picture of the achievements, challenges, and future perspectives of THz biophotonics.},

   experimentally and in simulation. To demonstrate our method, we applied
   it to randomized simulated signals with and without the presence of
   noise and to simple experimental measurements. We found excellent
   agreement between the simulated signals and those recreated based on
   results from our method, with this success also being replicated
   experimentally. These results were obtained at relatively low sampling
   rates, compared to standard methods, which is a key advantage to using a
   finite rate of innovation method as it allows for faster data
   acquisition and signal processing.},

Abstract = {Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) has shown promise in biomedical sample characterization and high characterization sensitivity is in demand due to the thin-film (TF) feature of the sample. This paper proposes an optimized multilayer structure for sensitive characterization of TF aqueous solutions in reflection THz-TDS. Theoretical simulations are conducted for structural optimization and the 75 mu m window-sample-mirror structure displays the best sensitivity compared to other sandwich structures and traditional THz measurement geometries. 0-20\% TF glucose solutions are then measured; and a spectral peak introduced by the proposed structure is observed to result in the high sensitivity. Our work provides a new way of customizing multilayer structure for THz thin-film characterization.

abstract = {Transdermal drug delivery (TDD) has been widely used in medical treatments due to various advantages, including delivering drugs at a consistent rate. However, variations in skin hydration can have a significant effect on the permeability of chemicals. Therefore, it is essential to study the changes in skin hydration induced by TDD patches for better control of the delivery rate. In this work, in vivo terahertz (THz) spectroscopy is conducted to quantitatively monitor human skin after the application of patches with different backing materials and propylene glycol concentrations. Changes in skin hydration and skin response to occlusion induced by other patches are investigated and compared. Our work demonstrates the potential application of in vivo THz measurements in label-free, non-invasive evaluation of transdermal patches on human skin and further reveals the mechanism behind the effect.},

The s and p channels of the multi-pixel terahertz emitter were modulated at different frequencies, thereby allowing orthogonal waveforms to be demultiplexed from the recorded signal in post-processing. The performance of the multi-pixel emitter used in this multiplexing scheme was comparable to that of a commercial single-polarization H-dipole antenna. The approach allowed two orthogonally polarized terahertz pulses to be recorded with good signal to noise (\&gt;1000:1) within half a second. We verified the capability of the spectrometer by characterizing a birefringent crystal and by imaging a polarization-sensitive metamaterial.

  abstract={Terahertz (THz) spectroscopy is a technique proving extremely useful for investigating various biomedical applications by virtue of its high sensitivity in the measurement of water content and non-ionizing nature. By combining this with sparse deconvolution, the THz response of skin directly underneath transdermal drug delivery (TDD) patches was isolated and reconstructed to determine the skin water content in vivo. Verification for this method was given by a comparison of skin measured through patches using sparse deconvolution, and skin measurements immediately following patch removal processed with standard approaches. It was found that patches with a non-permeable film backing hydrated the skin to a greater extent than permeable woven polyester fiber backed patches and that this hydration effect primarily occurs within the first 30 minutes of patch application and lasts for at least 24 hours given that the patch remains applied. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this sparse reconstruction method to track hydration levels through layers such as patches and identify scope for further applications including TDD patch development and wound healing techniques and monitoring.},

    abstract = { The dynamics of the drying process of polymer latexes after casting as a wet film onto a substrate are important to track as they influence the physical and mechanical properties and performance of the dried polymer films. Current methods used to follow this drying process include gravimetric analysis, coupled with advanced techniques like GARField-NMR or optical coherence tomography. The latter two methods provide height and spatial information in the z-direction, normal to the substrate, and occasionally in the xz- or yz-planes. Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) is a welcome addition as it provides both the structural and spectroscopic information in the parallel xy-plane, filling the geometric gap. Herein, we utilize THz-TDS to study the drying and film formation process of various polymer latexes with a broad range of glass transition temperatures. We showcase the applicability of this technique in obtaining 2D parallel hydration maps of the drying dispersions, in the form of droplets, using latex-dependent calibration lines. Our findings display known phenomena arising from the drying of the colloidal dispersions. }

Atomic layer deposition was used to coat silicon samples with dielectric layers to passivate the surfaces with a conductive polymer (PEDOT:PSS) subsequently deposited to enable electrical gating over the whole surface. The resulting gated photomodulators are characterized using photoconductance decay and photoluminescence imaging. A gated photomodulator with HfO2 passivation is then implemented into a THz time domain spectroscopy setup to demonstrate the potential for live photomodulation optimization during a single-pixel imaging experiment. We use the device to achieve a real-time improvement of the signal-to-noise ratio of the images by a factor of 8.},
