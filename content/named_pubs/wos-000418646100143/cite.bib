 abstract = {Measurement of the plasma frequency of a semiconductor film using
broadband surface plasmon is demonstrated in this paper. We
theoretically deduce a formula about the relation between plasma
frequency and characteristic surface plasmon frequency. The
characteristic surface plasmon frequency can be captured from the
cut-off frequency of the transmission spectra of the broadband surface
plasmon, which is used to measure the plasma frequency indirectly. The
plasma frequencies of an intrinsic indium antimonide with and without
optical illuminance are measured with a THz time-domain spectrometer at
room temperature. The experimental measured plasma frequencies fit well
with theoretical and simulation results. Compared with other methods,
the proposed method has a special advantage on measuring the plasma
frequency for a thin semiconductor film coated on other materials. (C)
