My name is Rafa Tu. I was born in Taiwan and grew up in the vibrant city of Xiamen, mainland China. My educational journey took a transformative turn during my time at an international high school, where I discovered a profound passion for physics.

Currently, I am an undergraduate student at National Sun Yat-sen University, where I am delving into the complexities of ultrafast optics under the mentorship of Prof. Rayko Ivanov Stantchev. This opportunity has allowed me to immerse myself in advanced research and contribute to the exciting advancements in this field.

Beyond academics, I have a deep appreciation for various sporting activities. Swimming, badminton, gaming, and billiards are not just hobbies but integral parts of my life that keep me balanced and energized.
