Satyam Priyanshu was born and brought up in India. His curiosity and interest for physics led him to pursue a higher degree in this field. He completed his Bachelor's degree in the year 2020, majoring in Physics honours from G.L.A College, India. 

Immediately after completing his Bachelor's degree, he enrolled himself into the Master's degree program at Nilamber-Pitamber University, India where he worked under Prof. Shrawan Kumar and got his degree completed by the end of year 2022. During his four semesters in his Master's degree, in addition to other subjects, he primarily focused on Spectroscopy and Electronics, grasping on the theoretical aspects of the subject and keen on transcending into the practical realisation of the same.

He is currently working in the Ultrafast Spectroscopy Laboratory at National Sun Yat-sen University, Taiwan where he is studying the applications of Terahertz waves under the guidance of Prof. Rayko Ivanov Stantchev.
