I was born and raised in Dera Ghazi Khan, Pakistan, where I developed a passion for science despite the challenges of growing up in a small, remote town. I pursued my B.Sc. with majors in Physics, Mathematics, and Chemistry, followed by an M.Sc. in Physics from Ghazi University, achieving a CGPA of 3.84/4.00. My growing interest in Physics led me to complete my MPhil at The Islamia University of Bahawalpur, with a thesis focused on "Coherent and Incoherent Scattering of Megavoltage Radiation," earning a CGPA of 3.72/4.00.

Throughout my academic journey, I have been committed to teaching, serving as a lecturer at various institutions, including Ghazi University and the University of Education Lahore (D.G. Khan Campus). I also earned a Bachelor of Education and completed the Erozgar digital skills training program.

Currently, I am pursuing my PhD at National Sun Yat-sen University in Taiwan, where I aim to deepen my research in the field of physics, driven by my passion for academic excellence and innovation.
