My name is Anam Ishaq, and I was born on February 2nd in Dera Ghazi Khan, Pakistan. I completed my BSc in General Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry from Govt Graduate College for Women, Model Town, Dera Ghazi Khan. Following my passion for physics, I pursued my MSc in Physics at Ghazi University, Dera Ghazi Khan, and later completed my MPhil in Physics from The Islamia University of Bahawalpur, specializing in medical physics. My thesis was on "Coherent Scattering and Incoherent Scattering of Megavoltage Radiation."

Following my MPhil, I taught as a visiting lecturer in the Physics Department at Ghazi University and the University of Education, Lahore, Dera Ghazi Khan Campus. My passion for physics led me to pursue my PhD at National Sun Yat-sen University, Taiwan, where I am continuing my academic journey in the field of physics.
