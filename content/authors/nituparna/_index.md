I am Nituparna Das, brought up in Assam, India. I completed my Master’s degree in Physics in 2024 from North-Eastern Hill University, Shillong, under the guidance of Dr. Satya Prakash Pati. During my postgraduate studies, I received two awards at research events and had the opportunity to present my work at an international convention.  

Inspired after attending Dr. Rayko’s webinar on THz devices and fiber-coupled systems, I decided to pursue a PhD under his mentorship. In September 2025, I joined his laboratory at National Sun Yat-sen University, Taiwan. My current research interests focus on the development of terahertz equipment for biomedical applications and semiconductor investigations.  

In the short term, my goal is to contribute as a research scientist or postdoctoral researcher in the fields of nanoelectronics and optoelectronics, working in collaboration with industry leaders to develop transformative technologies. In the long run, I aspire to return to India to establish a research center dedicated to sustainable solutions and advanced technologies.
