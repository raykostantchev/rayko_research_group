Lawrence Wu is a junior physics major at National Sun Yat-sen University, currently in his fourth year. Born in Taipei, Taiwan, he moved to Kaohsiung three years ago to pursue his university studies. After a brief suspension due to family reasons, he returned to continue his studies with a focus on experimental physics.

Lawrence recently joined Professor Rayko Ivanov Stantchev's research lab, where he is working on projects related to ultrafast optics and their applications in advanced technology.

In his free time, Lawrence enjoys working out, valuing the discipline and focus it brings to maintaining both physical and mental well-being.
