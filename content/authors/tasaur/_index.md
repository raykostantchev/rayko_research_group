My name is Tasaur Hussain and I was born the green valley and hearting valley of Kurram Parachinar, Pakistan I'm currently working as a PhD scholar of Physics at National sun yet Sen university Kaohsiung Taiwan and I'm passionate about my hobby or passion and I have many hobbies which include reading books, research activity, growing vegetables, and helping to other for solve their problems. 

My educational background is from Government High School Zeran Imam Bagh District Kurram Parachinar Pakistan where I did get my early education. Luckily, my hunger for knowledge didnâ€™t a conclusion when I was at school. After the successful completion of pre-university education with distinction, I joined Kohat University of Science and Technology for 2-years bachelor degree program. I studied Physics Mathematics as majors with extensive practical work in various laboratories. It was that fascinating academic years which provoked me to study Physics for further two years in M.Sc. Going through a competitive process I secured admission at Hazara University Mansehra Pakistan in Master of Science (M.Sc.) with Physics as major. I was enthusiastic about math and physics. This enthusiastic assisted me with acquiring a significant information on these area, and I was confessed to the school of my fantasies. I did bachelor degree in nanotechnology and later finished MS from Hazara university Mansehra.
