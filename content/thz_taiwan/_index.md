Following the establishment of the Taiwan THz society by [Shang Hua Yang](https://www.ee.nthu.edu.tw/shanghua/group-leader/index.html) in 2023, it was decided to start an annual meeting/conference relating to THz science and technology. 

On this webpage we will post the information about these meetings, such as venue location and talk schedule.
