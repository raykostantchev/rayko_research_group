abstract: Â© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH  &  Co. KGaA, Weinheim To promote potential
  applications of terahertz (THz) technology, more advanced functional THz devices
  with high performance are needed, including modulators, polarizers, lenses, wave
  retarders, and antireflection coatings. This work summarizes recent progress in
  THz components built on functional materials including graphene, vanadium dioxide,
  and metamaterials. The key message is that, while the choice of materials used in
  such devices is important, the geometry in which they are employed also has a significant
  effect on the performance achieved. In particular, devices operating in total internal
  reflection geometry are reviewed, and it is explained how this geometry is able
  to be exploited to achieve a variety of THz devices with broadband operation.
