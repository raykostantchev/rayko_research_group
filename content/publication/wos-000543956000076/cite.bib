 abstract = {Single pixel imaging (SPI) captures images without array detectors or
raster scanning. When combined with compressive sensing techniques it
enables novel solutions for high-speed optical imaging and spectroscopy.
However, when it comes to the real-time capture and analysis of a fast
event, the challenge is the inherent trade-off between frame rate and
image resolution. Due to the lack of sufficient sparsity and the
intrinsic iterative process, conventional compressed sensing techniques
have limited improvement in capturing natural scenes and displaying the
images in real time. In this work, we demonstrate a novel alternative
compressive imaging approach employing an efficient and
easy-implementation sampling scheme based on reordering the
deterministic Hadamard basis through their total variation. By this
means, the number of measurements and acquisition are reduced
significantly without needing complex minimization algorithms. We can
recover a 128x128 image with a sampling ratio of 5% at the signal peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 23.8dB, achieving super sub-Nyquist
sampling SPI. Compared to other widely used sampling e.g. standard
Hadamard protocols and Gaussian matrix methods, this approach results in
a significant improvement both in the compression ratio and image
reconstruction quality, enabling SPI for high frame rate imaging or
video applications.},
