abstract: We propose a polarization sensitive terahertz time-domain spectrometer that
  can record orthogonally polarized terahertz fields simultaneously, using fibre-coupled
  photoconductive antennas and a scheme that modulated the emitter's polarization.
  The s and p channels of the multi-pixel terahertz emitter were modulated at different
  frequencies, thereby allowing orthogonal waveforms to be demultiplexed from the
  recorded signal in post-processing. The performance of the multi-pixel emitter used
  in this multiplexing scheme was comparable to that of a commercial single-polarization
  H-dipole antenna. The approach allowed two orthogonally polarized terahertz pulses
  to be recorded with good signal to noise (&gt;1000:1) within half a second. We verified
  the capability of the spectrometer by characterizing a birefringent crystal and
  by imaging a polarization-sensitive metamaterial. This work has significant potential
  to improve the speed of terahertz polarization sensitive applications, such as ellipsometry
  and imaging.
