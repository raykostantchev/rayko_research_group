abstract: ' The dynamics of the drying process of polymer latexes after casting as
  a wet film onto a substrate are important to track as they influence the physical
  and mechanical properties and performance of the dried polymer films. Current methods
  used to follow this drying process include gravimetric analysis, coupled with advanced
  techniques like GARField-NMR or optical coherence tomography. The latter two methods
  provide height and spatial information in the z-direction, normal to the substrate,
  and occasionally in the xz- or yz-planes. Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS)
  is a welcome addition as it provides both the structural and spectroscopic information
  in the parallel xy-plane, filling the geometric gap. Herein, we utilize THz-TDS
  to study the drying and film formation process of various polymer latexes with a
  broad range of glass transition temperatures. We showcase the applicability of this
  technique in obtaining 2D parallel hydration maps of the drying dispersions, in
  the form of droplets, using latex-dependent calibration lines. Our findings display
  known phenomena arising from the drying of the colloidal dispersions. '
