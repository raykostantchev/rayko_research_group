 abstract = {Terahertz (THz) thin-film total internal reflection (TF-TIR)
spectroscopy is shown to have an enhanced sensitivity to the vibrational
properties of thin films in comparison with standard THz transmission
spectroscopy. This increased sensitivity was used to track photoinduced
modifications to the structure of thin films of methylammonium (MA) lead
halide, MAPbI(3-x)Br(x) (x = 0, 0.5, 1, and 3). Initially, illumination
strengthened the phonon modes around 2 THz, associated with Pb-I stretch
modes coupled to the MA ions, whereas the 1 THz twist modes of the
inorganic octahedra did not alter in strength. Under longer term
illumination, the 1 THz phonon modes of encapsulated films slowly
reduced in strength, whereas in films exposed to moisture and oxygen,
these phonons weaken more rapidly and blue-shift in frequency. The rapid
monitoring of environmentally induced changes to the vibrational modes
afforded by TF-TIR spectroscopy offers applications in the
characterization and quality control of the perovskite thin-film solar
cells and other thin-film semiconductors.},
