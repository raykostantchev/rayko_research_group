 abstract = {In the recent efforts to investigate the drying process of latices, the techniques used to explore this mechanism are incapable of determining the water content of the sample along its surface area [1], [2]. To overcome this challenge, Terahertz Time-Domain Spectroscopy (THz-TDS) was used to simultaneously obtain structural and spectroscopic data of the samples being analysed. This resulted in a new method for the analysis of latex film formation, and the extracted data was capable of producing quantitative 2D hydration maps of these samples in the liquid state.},
