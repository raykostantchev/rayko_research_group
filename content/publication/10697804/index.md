abstract: In the recent efforts to investigate the drying process of latices, the
  techniques used to explore this mechanism are incapable of determining the water
  content of the sample along its surface area [1], [2]. To overcome this challenge,
  Terahertz Time-Domain Spectroscopy (THz-TDS) was used to simultaneously obtain structural
  and spectroscopic data of the samples being analysed. This resulted in a new method
  for the analysis of latex film formation, and the extracted data was capable of
  producing quantitative 2D hydration maps of these samples in the liquid state.
