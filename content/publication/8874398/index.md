abstract: Measuring living systems is the ultimate challenge for biomedical research,
  as we do not want the act of taking the measurement to affect the system. Taking
  the measurement quickly has been a priority hitherto, but now that acquisition speeds
  are faster, we need to consider other aspects in more detail. Some key variables
  when measuring human skin in vivo include the contact pressure made with the THz
  probe and the duration of contact. In this talk I will present work by my group
  on THz spatial light modulators and other devices exploiting the total internal
  reflection geometry (TIR) which were developed to facilitate speeding up THz image
  acquisition and polarization control. I will explain how the TIR geometry of the
  THz modulator enhances sensitivity, and that this sensitivity can be useful for
  thin film material characterization. I will also present some of our recent results
  on applying THz imaging to characterize human skin in vivo as well as improving
  the contrast in excised wax embedded slices.
