abstract: 'Â© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim Water diffusion and the
  concentration profile within the skin significantly affect the surrounding chemical
  absorption and molecular synthesis. Occluding the skin causes water to accumulate
  in the top layer of the skin (the stratum corneum [SC]) and also affects the water
  diffusivity. Scar treatments such as silicone gel and silicone sheets make use of
  occlusion to increase skin hydration. However with existing techniques, it is not
  possible to quantitatively measure the diffusivity of the water during occlusion:
  current methods determine water diffusivity by measuring the water evaporated through
  the skin and thus require the skin to breathe. In this work, we use the high sensitivity
  of terahertz light to water to study how the water content in the SC changes upon
  occlusion. From our measurements, we can solve the diffusion equations in the SC
  to deduce the water concentration profile in occluded skin and subsequently to determine
  the diffusivity. To our knowledge, this is the first work showing how the diffusivity
  of human skin can be measured during occlusion and we envisage this paper as being
  used as a guide for non-invasively determining the diffusivity of occluded human
  skin in vivo.'
