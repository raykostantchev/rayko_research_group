abstract: A scheme is proposed and demonstrated that realizes the rapid simultaneous
  measurement of orthogonal terahertz fields. A fibre-coupled multi-pixel THz emitter
  on InGaAs generated orthogonal polarization states, with a dynamic range and bandwidth
  comparable to a commercial antenna. We developed a dual-frequency modulation/demodulation
  scheme that used a conventional photoconductive detector to record the orthogonal
  polarization states. This work has significant potential to improve the speed of
  polarization-resolved THz spectroscopy and imaging. We demonstrate its efficiency
  by characterizing birefringent crystalline materials and anisotropic metamaterial.
