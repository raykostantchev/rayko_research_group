 abstract = {As an essential processing step in many disciplines, signal denoising
efficiently improves data quality without extra cost. However, it is
relatively under-utilized for terahertz spectroscopy. The major
technique reported uses wavelet denoising in the time-domain, which has
a fuzzy physical meaning and limited performance in low-frequency and
water-vapor regions. Here, we work from a new perspective by
reconstructing the transfer function to remove noise-induced
oscillations. The method is fully objective without a need for defining
a threshold. Both reflection imaging and transmission imaging were
conducted. The experimental results show that both low- and
high-frequency noise and the water-vapor influence were efficiently
removed. The spectrum accuracy was also improved, and the image contrast
was significantly enhanced. The signal-to-noise ratio of the leaf image
was increased up to 10 dB, with the 6 dB bandwidth being extended by
over 0.5 THz.},
