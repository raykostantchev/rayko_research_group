abstract: Subwavelength perovskite thin films can only cause less than a 10% intensity
  reduction of the transmitted terahertz (THz) signal; this small dynamic range makes
  it difficult to track minor changes in the phonon modes. We propose a THz thin film
  total internal reflection (TF-TIR) spectroscopy technique to characterize photo-induced
  spectral changes of MAPbI3, MAPbI2.5Br0.5, MAPbI2Br1 and MAPbBr3. Our approach enhanced
  the THz responsivity of the perovskites thin films by a factor of 4 compared to
  THz transmission spectroscopy. The light induced the strength of the phonon modes
  at around 2 THz to increase after 5 min of illumination, corresponding to the enhanced
  stretching of the lead halide bond. After 10 min, the strength of the phonon modes
  at around 1 THz started to decrease, corresponding to the weakened bending of the
  lead halide bond. Blue shifts were observed on the resonant frequencies apart from
  MAPbBr3. By comparing the results of four perovskites, we conclude the perovskites
  that have higher iodide ratio are more unstable in the presence of light and moisture.
  With the support of X-ray diffraction measurements, we suggest that THz TF-TIR spectroscopy
  provides distinct information of vibrational kinetics of lead-halide bond in perovskites.
