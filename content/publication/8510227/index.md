abstract: Electron-hole pair photoexcitation switches a semiconductor's response from
  dielectric to conducting. We show that this process is most efficient in a total
  internal reflection (TIR) geometry allowing the use of cheaper, less powerful light
  sources. Further, by employing a digital micromirror device to spatially pattern
  the photoexcitation area, we perform imaging with single-element detector and present
  solutions to the optical problems of imaging in this geometry. We finally show that
  by taking into account the carrier lifetimes in the signal processing one can improve
  the acquisition rate by a factor 5.
