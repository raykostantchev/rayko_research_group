abstract: Transdermal drug delivery (TDD) has been widely used in medical treatments
  due to various advantages, including delivering drugs at a consistent rate. However,
  variations in skin hydration can have a significant effect on the permeability of
  chemicals. Therefore, it is essential to study the changes in skin hydration induced
  by TDD patches for better control of the delivery rate. In this work, in vivo terahertz
  (THz) spectroscopy is conducted to quantitatively monitor human skin after the application
  of patches with different backing materials and propylene glycol concentrations.
  Changes in skin hydration and skin response to occlusion induced by other patches
  are investigated and compared. Our work demonstrates the potential application of
  in vivo THz measurements in label-free, non-invasive evaluation of transdermal patches
  on human skin and further reveals the mechanism behind the effect.
