abstract: Among all terahertz (THz) imaging techniques, compressed sensing imaging
  shows the potential to perform large area detection with faster acquisition time
  and capability to be integrated with single pixel THz receiver. However, despite
  the mentioned advantages, unevenly distributed THz beam and spatial modulated optical
  pump begin to affect the image system and reduce the reconstruction quality within
  the utilization of larger field of view. Hence, we establish a THz compressed sensing
  imaging system with equalization procedure along orthogonal basis pursuit (OMP)
  algorithm to mitigate these effects. Results from imaging experiments demonstrate
  the effectiveness of the proposed equalization method in improving image reconstruction,
  presenting a precise mathematical model simulating and non-ideal phenomenon calibration.
