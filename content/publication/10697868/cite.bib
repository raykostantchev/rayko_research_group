 abstract = {Among all terahertz (THz) imaging techniques, compressed sensing imaging shows the potential to perform large area detection with faster acquisition time and capability to be integrated with single pixel THz receiver. However, despite the mentioned advantages, unevenly distributed THz beam and spatial modulated optical pump begin to affect the image system and reduce the reconstruction quality within the utilization of larger field of view. Hence, we establish a THz compressed sensing imaging system with equalization procedure along orthogonal basis pursuit (OMP) algorithm to mitigate these effects. Results from imaging experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed equalization method in improving image reconstruction, presenting a precise mathematical model simulating and non-ideal phenomenon calibration.},
