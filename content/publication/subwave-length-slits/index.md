abstract: We present measurements and analytical modeling which demonstrate enhanced
  THz transmission through a subwavelength aperture via light-induced diffraction.
  Our experiment involves photoexciting a conducting pattern onto a silicon interface
  so as to control and modulate the near-field interference of THz radiation. To illustrate
  the concept, we photoexcite a simple double-conducting stripe pattern on the incident
  side of a silicon wafer which has a slit etched into a gold film on the exit side.
  We show that under certain resonant conditions set by the stripe dimensions, a constructive
  near-field interference can bring about enhanced transmission through the slit.
  By raster scanning the excitation pattern under these resonant conditions, one can
  build an image of subwavelength features such as the slit aperture of our sample.
