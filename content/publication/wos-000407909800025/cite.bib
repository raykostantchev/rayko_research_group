 abstract = {We demonstrate a form of near-field terahertz (THz) imaging that is
compatible with compressed sensing algorithms. By spatially
photomodulating THz pulses using a set of shaped binary optical patterns
and employing a 6-mu m-thick silicon wafer, we are able to reconstruct
THz images of an object placed on the exit interface of the wafer. A
single-element detector is used to measure the electric field amplitude
of transmitted THz radiation for each projected pattern, with the
ultra-thin wafer allowing us to access the THz evanescent near fields to
achieve a spatial resolution of similar to 9 mu m (lambda/45 at 0.75
THz). We conclude by experimentally improving the image rate by a factor
of similar to 3 by undersampling the object with adaptive and compressed
sensing algorithms.},
