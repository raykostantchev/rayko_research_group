abstract: © 2017 Optical Society of America. We demonstrate a form of near-field terahertz
  (THz) imaging that is compatible with compressed sensing algorithms. By spatially
  photomodulating THz pulses using a set of shaped binary optical patterns and employing
  a 6-$μ$m-thick silicon wafer, we are able to reconstruct THz images of an object
  placed on the exit interface of the wafer. A single-element detector is used to
  measure the electric field amplitude of transmitted THz radiation for each projected
  pattern, with the ultra-thin wafer allowing us to access the THz evanescent near
  fields to achieve a spatial resolution of ∼9 $μ$m ($łambda$∕45 at 0.75 THz). We
  conclude by experimentally improving the image rate by a factor of ∼3 by undersampling
  the object with adaptive and compressed sensing algorithms.
