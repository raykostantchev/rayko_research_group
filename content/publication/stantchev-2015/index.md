abstract: Â© 2015 American Physical Society.We present measurements and analytical
  modeling which demonstrate enhanced THz transmission through a subwavelength aperture
  via light-induced diffraction. Our experiment involves photoexciting a conducting
  pattern onto a silicon interface so as to control and modulate the near-field interference
  of THz radiation. To illustrate the concept, we photoexcite a simple double-conducting
  stripe pattern on the incident side of a silicon wafer which has a slit etched into
  a gold film on the exit side. We show that under certain resonant conditions set
  by the stripe dimensions, a constructive near-field interference can bring about
  enhanced transmission through the slit. By raster scanning the excitation pattern
  under these resonant conditions, one can build an image of subwavelength features
  such as the slit aperture of our sample.
