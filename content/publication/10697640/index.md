abstract: THz imaging is to be used in many applications varying from semiconductor
  quality control, disease diagnosis, non-destructive investigations and security
  screening. What underpins this is the lenses used in the imaging design, and the
  normal spherical lens suffers from spherical aberrations that require concentrated
  effort to be removed. Here, we derive an analytical modification to the ordinary
  spherical lens formula that reduces the focal spot size of short-focal lens THz
  lenses. We 3D print our lenses to validate their performance.
