abstract: Terahertz-spectroscopy probes dynamics and spectral response of collective
  vibrational modes in condensed phase, which can yield insight into composition and
  topology. However, due to the long wavelengths employed (lambda = 300 mu m at 1THz),
  diffraction limited imaging is typically restricted to spatial resolutions around
  a millimeter. Here, we demonstrate a new form of subwavelength hyperspectral, polarization-resolved
  THz imaging which employs an optical pattern projected onto a 6 mu m-thin silicon
  wafer to achieve near-field modulation of a co-incident THz pulse. By placing near-field
  scatterers, one can measure the interaction of object with the evanescent THz fields.
  Further, by measuring the temporal evolution of the THz field a sample's permittivity
  can be extracted with 65 mu m spatial resolution due to the presence of evanescent
  fields. Here, we present the first application of this new approach to articular
  cartilage. We show that the THz permittivity in this material varies progressively
  from the superficial zone to the deep layer, and that this correlates with a change
  in orientation of the collagen fibrils that compose the extracellular matrix (ECM)
  of the tissue. Our approach enables direct interrogation of the sample's biophysical
  properties, in this case concerning the structure and permittivity of collagen fibrils
  and their anisotropic organisation in connective tissue.
