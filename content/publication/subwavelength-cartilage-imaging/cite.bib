 abstract = {Terahertz-spectroscopy probes dynamics and spectral response of
collective vibrational modes in condensed phase, which can yield insight
into composition and topology. However, due to the long wavelengths
employed (lambda = 300 mu m at 1THz), diffraction limited imaging is
typically restricted to spatial resolutions around a millimeter. Here,
we demonstrate a new form of subwavelength hyperspectral,
polarization-resolved THz imaging which employs an optical pattern
projected onto a 6 mu m-thin silicon wafer to achieve near-field
modulation of a co-incident THz pulse. By placing near-field scatterers,
one can measure the interaction of object with the evanescent THz
fields. Further, by measuring the temporal evolution of the THz field a
sample's permittivity can be extracted with 65 mu m spatial resolution
due to the presence of evanescent fields. Here, we present the first
application of this new approach to articular cartilage. We show that
the THz permittivity in this material varies progressively from the
superficial zone to the deep layer, and that this correlates with a
change in orientation of the collagen fibrils that compose the
extracellular matrix (ECM) of the tissue. Our approach enables direct
interrogation of the sample's biophysical properties, in this case
concerning the structure and permittivity of collagen fibrils and their
anisotropic organisation in connective tissue.},
