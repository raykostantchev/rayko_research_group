abstract: A compact and easy-to-use terahertz spectrometer is proposed to realize
  in-situ and fast measurement of both the s- and p- polarizations. A multi-pixel
  emitter is integrated into a handheld fiber-based terahertz scanner working in a
  reflection configuration. This self-referenced and mechanical rotation-free ellipsometer
  will significantly speed up the measurement process and has great potential for
  use in vivo skin measurements.
