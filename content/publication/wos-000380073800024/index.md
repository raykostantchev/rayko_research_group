abstract: Terahertz (THz) imaging can see through otherwise opaque materials. However,
  because of the long wavelengths of THz radiation (lambda = 400 mu m at 0.75 THz),
  far-field THz imaging techniques suffer from low resolution compared to visible
  wavelengths. We demonstrate noninvasive, near-field THz imaging with subwavelength
  resolution. We project a time-varying, intense (>100 mu J/cm(2)) optical pattern
  onto a silicon wafer, which spatially modulates the transmission of synchronous
  pulse of THz radiation. An unknown object is placed on the hidden side of the silicon,
  and the far-field THz transmission corresponding to each mask is recorded by a single-element
  detector. Knowledge of the patterns and of the corresponding detector signal are
  combined to give an image of the object. Using this technique, we image a printed
  circuit board on the underside of a 115-mu m-thick silicon wafer with similar to
  100-mu m (lambda/4) resolution. With subwavelength resolution and the inherent sensitivity
  to local conductivity, it is possible to detect fissures in the circuitry wiring
  of a few micrometers in size. THz imaging systems of this type will have other uses
  too, where noninvasive measurement or imaging of concealed structures is necessary,
  such as in semiconductor manufacturing or in ex vivo bioimaging.
