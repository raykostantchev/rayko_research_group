 abstract = {Terahertz (THz) imaging can see through otherwise opaque materials.
However, because of the long wavelengths of THz radiation (lambda = 400
mu m at 0.75 THz), far-field THz imaging techniques suffer from low
resolution compared to visible wavelengths. We demonstrate noninvasive,
near-field THz imaging with subwavelength resolution. We project a
time-varying, intense (>100 mu J/cm(2)) optical pattern onto a silicon
wafer, which spatially modulates the transmission of synchronous pulse
of THz radiation. An unknown object is placed on the hidden side of the
silicon, and the far-field THz transmission corresponding to each mask
is recorded by a single-element detector. Knowledge of the patterns and
of the corresponding detector signal are combined to give an image of
the object. Using this technique, we image a printed circuit board on
the underside of a 115-mu m-thick silicon wafer with similar to 100-mu m
(lambda/4) resolution. With subwavelength resolution and the inherent
sensitivity to local conductivity, it is possible to detect fissures in
the circuitry wiring of a few micrometers in size. THz imaging systems
of this type will have other uses too, where noninvasive measurement or
imaging of concealed structures is necessary, such as in semiconductor
manufacturing or in ex vivo bioimaging.},
