 abstract = {Recently, finite rate of innovation methods have been successfully
applied to achieve low sampling rates in many areas, such as for
ultrasound and radio signals. However, to the best of our knowledge,
there are no journal publications applying this to real terahertz
signals. In this work, we mathematically describe a finite rate of
innovation method applied specifically to terahertz signals both
experimentally and in simulation. To demonstrate our method, we applied
it to randomized simulated signals with and without the presence of
noise and to simple experimental measurements. We found excellent
agreement between the simulated signals and those recreated based on
results from our method, with this success also being replicated
experimentally. These results were obtained at relatively low sampling
rates, compared to standard methods, which is a key advantage to using a
finite rate of innovation method as it allows for faster data
acquisition and signal processing.},
