abstract: Recently, finite rate of innovation methods have been successfully applied
  to achieve low sampling rates in many areas, such as for ultrasound and radio signals.
  However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no journal publications applying
  this to real terahertz signals. In this work, we mathematically describe a finite
  rate of innovation method applied specifically to terahertz signals both experimentally
  and in simulation. To demonstrate our method, we applied it to randomized simulated
  signals with and without the presence of noise and to simple experimental measurements.
  We found excellent agreement between the simulated signals and those recreated based
  on results from our method, with this success also being replicated experimentally.
  These results were obtained at relatively low sampling rates, compared to standard
  methods, which is a key advantage to using a finite rate of innovation method as
  it allows for faster data acquisition and signal processing.
