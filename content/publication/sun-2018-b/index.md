abstract: Terahertz (THz) thin-film total internal reflection (TF-TIR) spectroscopy
  is shown to have an enhanced sensitivity to the vibrational properties of thin films
  in comparison with standard THz transmission spectroscopy. This increased sensitivity
  was used to track photoinduced modifications to the structure of thin films of methylammonium
  (MA) lead halide, MAPbI3–xBrx (x = 0, 0.5, 1, and 3). Initially, illumination strengthened
  the phonon modes around 2 THz, associated with Pb–I stretch modes coupled to the
  MA ions, whereas the 1 THz twist modes of the inorganic octahedra did not alter
  in strength. Under longer term illumination, the 1 THz phonon modes of encapsulated
  films slowly reduced in strength, whereas in films exposed to moisture and oxygen,
  these phonons weaken more rapidly and blue-shift in frequency. The rapid monitoring
  of environmentally induced changes to the vibrational modes afforded by TF-TIR spectroscopy
  offers applications in the characterization and quality control of the perovskite
  thin...
