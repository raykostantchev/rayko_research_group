abstract: Measurement of the plasma frequency of a semiconductor film using broadband
  surface plasmon is demonstrated in this paper. We theoretically deduce a formula
  about the relation between plasma frequency and characteristic surface plasmon frequency.
  The characteristic surface plasmon frequency can be captured from the cut-off frequency
  of the transmission spectra of the broadband surface plasmon, which is used to measure
  the plasma frequency indirectly. The plasma frequencies of an intrinsic indium antimonide
  with and without optical illuminance are measured with a THz time-domain spectrometer
  at room temperature. The experimental measured plasma frequencies fit well with
  theoretical and simulation results. Compared with other methods, the proposed method
  has a special advantage on measuring the plasma frequency for a thin semiconductor
  film coated on other materials. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.
