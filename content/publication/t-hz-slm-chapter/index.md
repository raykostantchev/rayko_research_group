abstract: Terahertz imaging looks set to become an integral part of future applications
  from semiconductor quality control to medical diagnosis. This will only become a
  reality when the technology is sufficiently cheap and capabilities adequate to compete
  with others. Single-pixel cameras use a spatial light modulator and a detector with
  no spatial-resolution in their imaging process. The spatial-modulator is key as
  it imparts a series of encoding masks on the beam and the detector measures the
  dot product of each mask and the object, thereby allowing computers to recover an
  image via post-processing. They are inherently slower than parallel-pixel imaging
  arrays although they are more robust and cheaper, hence are highly applicable to
  the terahertz regime. This chapter dedicates itself to terahertz single-pixel cameras;
  their current implementations, future directions and how they compare to other terahertz
  imaging techniques. We start by outlining the competing imaging techniques, then
  we discuss the theory behind single-pixel imaging; the main section shows the methods
  of spatially modulating a terahertz beam; and finally there is a discussion about
  the future limits of such cameras and the concluding remarks express the authors'
  vision for the future of single-pixel THz cameras.
