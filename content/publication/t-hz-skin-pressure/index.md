abstract: Terahertz (THz) light is non-ionizing and highly sensitive to subtle changes
  in water concentration which can be indicative of disease. The short THz penetration
  depth in bio-samples restricts in vivo measurements to be in a reflection geometry
  and the sample is often placed onto an imaging window. Upon contacting the imaging
  window, occlusion and compression of the skin affect the THz response. If not appropriately
  controlled, this could cause misleading results. In this work, we investigate and
  quantify how the applied pressure affects the THz response of skin and employ a
  stratified model to help understand the mechanisms at play. This work will enable
  future THz studies to have a more rigorous experimental protocol, which in turn
  will facilitate research in various potential biomedical applications under investigation.
