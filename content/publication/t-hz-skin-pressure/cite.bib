@article{THz_skin_pressure,
 abstract = {Terahertz (THz) light is non-ionizing and highly sensitive to subtle
changes in water concentration which can be indicative of disease. The
short THz penetration depth in bio-samples restricts in vivo
measurements to be in a reflection geometry and the sample is often
placed onto an imaging window. Upon contacting the imaging window,
occlusion and compression of the skin affect the THz response. If not
appropriately controlled, this could cause misleading results. In this
work, we investigate and quantify how the applied pressure affects the
THz response of skin and employ a stratified model to help understand
the mechanisms at play. This work will enable future THz studies to have
a more rigorous experimental protocol, which in turn will facilitate
research in various potential biomedical applications under
investigation. (C) 2018 Optical Society of America under the terms of
