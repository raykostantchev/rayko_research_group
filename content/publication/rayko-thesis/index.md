abstract: The terehertz radiation potentially has many interesting applications. From
  air port security, non-destructive evaluations of electronics and space shuttle
  panels, to non-ionizing photon energies with the potential to detect cancer growths
  and quality control of pharmaceutical tables, the list of potential applications
  is vast as shown in chapter 1. However, there is a lack of cheap, robust and efficient
  THz sources, detectors and modulators. Further, the long wavelengths render micron
  sized details unseeable with far-field imaging techniques. This has rendered most
  imaging applications unusable in the real world. This thesis is based around demonstrating
  an imaging technique that uses a near-field THz modulator to obtain sub-wavelength
  images. There are five distinct experimental demonstrations that show the full capacity
  of the imaging technique developed here. Chapter 2 gives an outline of the background
  physics knowledge needed to understand the entirety of the thesis. An outline of
  the mathematics used for modellingis given in the latter part of the chapter as
  well. Chapter 3 gives a background on the THz generation and detection techniques
  used in our THz-TDS system, optical rectification and electro-optic sampling in
  ZnTe. Further more, our system is capable of photoexciting a sample in conjunction
  to it being probed with a THz pulse. For the most part, we photoexcite a silicon
  wafer in order to use its photoconductive properties to modulate our THz pulse.
  Our photoexcitation pulse is spatially modulated, via a digital micromirror device,
  which in turn spatially modulates our THz pulse. This patterned THz pulse can then
  be used with a single-element detector to perform imaging. How to do this and the
  type of patterns needed is described in the latter part of chapter 3. Chapter 4
  is the first demonstration that photo-induced conductivity in silicon can be used
  to manipulate evanescent THz fields for sub-wavelength imaging. For this, we imaged
  a 1D sub-wavelength slit and were able to obtain the slit profile with 65$μ$m ($łambda$/6
  at 0.75T Hz) resolution. Chapter 5 demonstrates what limits the resolution in our
  imaging system. Namely, the distance which the patterned THz pulse propagates to
  the object from where itwas spatially modulated. We demonstrate 9$μ$m ($łambda$/45
  at 0.75T Hz) resolution using an ultra-thin (6$μ$m) silicon wafer. At such sub-wavelength
  scales polarization becomes an important factor. We show how one can use polarization
  in order to detect 8$μ$m breaks in a circuit board hidden by 115$μ$m of silicon.
  Chapter 6 concerns itself with showing how noise affects our images. Further more,
  our imaging system is compatible with compressed sensing where one can obtain an
  image using fewer measurements than the number of pixels. We investigate how different
  under-sampling techniques perform in our system. Note under-sampling at sub-wavelength
  resolutions, as is done here, is rather unusual and is of yet to be demonstrated
  for other part of the electro-magnetic spectrum. Chapter 7 shows that one does not
  need to photoexcite silicon. One can in principle illuminate any material, hence
  we photoexcite graphene with our spatially modulated optical pulses. This allows
  us to obtain the THz photoconductive response of our graphene sample with sub-wavelength
  resolution (75$μ$m ≈ $łambda$/5 at 0.75T Hz). We compare our results with Raman
  spectra maps. We find a clear correlation between THz photoconductivity and carrier
  concentration (extracted from Raman). Chapter 8 exploits the full capacity of our
  imaging system by performing hyper-spectral near-field THz imaging on a biological
  sample. For this, in our imaged field of view, we measured the full temporal trace
  of our THz pulse at a sub-wavelength spatial resolution. This has allowed us to
  extract the frequency dependent permittivity of our biological sample, articular
  cartilage, over our spectral range (0.2-2T Hz). We find the permittivity to change
  on a sub-wavelength scale in correlation with changes in the structure of our sample.
  However, the permittivity extraction procedures that have been developed make a
  far-field approximation. We mathematically show the presence of the THz near-fields
  to render the long wavelength spectral parts of our extracted permittivity to be
  wrong. Chapter 9 is where we conclude and point out the main problem that needs
  to be addressed in order to make the measurements presented here more accessible
  to others. Namely, the cost of the laser system powering the THz-TDS and how to
  further reduce the acquisition time.
