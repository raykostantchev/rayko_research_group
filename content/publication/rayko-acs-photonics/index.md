abstract: We report the first use of a convolutional neural network for terahertz
  (THz) imaging combined with a single-pixel camera to achieve high quality hyperspectral
  THz imaging 10x faster than the current commercial systems, with faster potential
  only limited by noise. Imaging with a spatial light modulator (SLM) relies on projecting
  a set of spatial patterns onto an object and recording the transmission with a single-pixel
  detector, and an optical delay unit (ODU) is used to obtain the terahertz time-of-flight
  information. A key breakthrough in this work is to synchronize the equipment to
  not need any time to instruct the ODU to move while projecting the patterns.
