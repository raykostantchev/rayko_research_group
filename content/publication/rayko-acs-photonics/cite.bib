 abstract = {We report the first use of a convolutional neural network for terahertz
(THz) imaging combined with a single-pixel camera to achieve high
quality hyperspectral THz imaging 10x faster than the current commercial
systems, with faster potential only limited by noise. Imaging with a
spatial light modulator (SLM) relies on projecting a set of spatial
patterns onto an object and recording the transmission with a
single-pixel detector, and an optical delay unit (ODU) is used to obtain
the terahertz time-of-flight information. A key breakthrough in this
work is to synchronize the equipment to not need any time to instruct
the ODU to move while projecting the patterns.},
