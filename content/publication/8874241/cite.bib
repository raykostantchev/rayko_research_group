 abstract = {We use THz imaging to measure and quantify the effects of applying silicone gel sheeting on skin. We show how THz measurements can detect subtle hydration changes caused by the silicone gel sheeting, indicating that THz imaging is a promising method to quantitatively assess skin treatment strategies.},
