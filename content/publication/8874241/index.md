abstract: We use THz imaging to measure and quantify the effects of applying silicone
  gel sheeting on skin. We show how THz measurements can detect subtle hydration changes
  caused by the silicone gel sheeting, indicating that THz imaging is a promising
  method to quantitatively assess skin treatment strategies.
