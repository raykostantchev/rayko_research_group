 abstract = {Â© 2018 American Chemical Society. THz thin film total internal reflection (TF-TIR) spectroscopy is shown to have an enhanced sensitivity to the vibrational properties of thin films in comparison to standard THz transmission spectroscopy. This increased sensitivity was used to track photo-induced modifications to the structure of thin films of methylammonium (MA) lead halide, MAPbI3-xBrx (x=0, 0.5, 1, 3). Initially, illumination strengthened the phonon modes around 2THz, associated with Pb-I stretch modes coupled to the MA ions, while the 1THz twist modes of the inorganic octahedra did not alter in strength. Under longer term illumination the 1THz phonon modes of encapsulated films slowly reduced in strength, while in films exposed to moisture and oxygen these phonons weaken more rapidly and blueshift in frequency. The rapid monitoring of environmentally-induced changes to the vibrational modes afforded by TF-TIR spectroscopy offers applications in the characterization and quality control of perovskite thin-film solar cells and other thin-film semiconductors.},
