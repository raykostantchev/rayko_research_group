abstract: Â© 2018 American Chemical Society. THz thin film total internal reflection
  (TF-TIR) spectroscopy is shown to have an enhanced sensitivity to the vibrational
  properties of thin films in comparison to standard THz transmission spectroscopy.
  This increased sensitivity was used to track photo-induced modifications to the
  structure of thin films of methylammonium (MA) lead halide, MAPbI3-xBrx (x=0, 0.5,
  1, 3). Initially, illumination strengthened the phonon modes around 2THz, associated
  with Pb-I stretch modes coupled to the MA ions, while the 1THz twist modes of the
  inorganic octahedra did not alter in strength. Under longer term illumination the
  1THz phonon modes of encapsulated films slowly reduced in strength, while in films
  exposed to moisture and oxygen these phonons weaken more rapidly and blueshift in
  frequency. The rapid monitoring of environmentally-induced changes to the vibrational
  modes afforded by TF-TIR spectroscopy offers applications in the characterization
  and quality control of perovskite thin-film solar cells and other thin-film semiconductors.
