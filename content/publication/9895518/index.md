abstract: 'A major obstacle to non-contact measurement of in-vivo skin samples is
  the alignment sensitivity of reflected THz pulses. Movement of human skin on the
  relevant length scales of $10 Î¼ mathrmm$ is faster than the movement capabilities
  of current state of the art medical robots: this means accurate non-contact alignment
  when imaging human skin is currently impossible with mechanical means. Presented
  here is a promising neutral network approach to correct the pulse from a misaligned
  terahertz system. This low-cost alternative to mechanical alignment correction will
  contribute to the development of in-vivo biomedical applications of THz imaging.'
