 abstract = {Silicone gel sheeting (SGS) is widely used for scar treatment; however,
studies showing its interaction with skin and efficacy of scar treatment
are still lacking. THz light is non-ionizing and highly sensitive to
changes in Water content and thus skin hydration. In this work, we use
in-vivo THz imaging to monitor how SGS affects the THz response of human
skin during occlusion, and the associated THz reflectivity and
refractive index changes are presented. We find that SGS effectively
hydrates the skin beneath it, with minimal lateral effects beyond the
sheeting. Our work demonstrates that THz imaging is able to detect the
subtle hydration changes on the surface of human skin caused by SGS, and
it has the potential to be used to evaluate different scar treatment
strategies. (C) 2019 Optical Society of America under the terms of the
