 abstract = {Water diffusion and the concentration profile within the skin
significantly affect the surrounding chemical absorption and molecular
synthesis. Occluding the skin causes water to accumulate in the top
layer of the skin (the stratum corneum [SC]) and also affects the
water diffusivity. Scar treatments such as silicone gel and silicone
sheets make use of occlusion to increase skin hydration. However with
existing techniques, it is not possible to quantitatively measure the
diffusivity of the water during occlusion: current methods determine
water diffusivity by measuring the water evaporated through the skin and
thus require the skin to breathe. In this work, we use the high
sensitivity of terahertz light to water to study how the water content
in the SC changes upon occlusion. From our measurements, we can solve
the diffusion equations in the SC to deduce the water concentration
profile in occluded skin and subsequently to determine the diffusivity.
To our knowledge, this is the first work showing how the diffusivity of
human skin can be measured during occlusion and we envisage this paper
as being used as a guide for non-invasively determining the diffusivity
of occluded human skin in vivo.},
