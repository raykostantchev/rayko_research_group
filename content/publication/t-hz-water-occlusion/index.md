abstract: 'Water diffusion and the concentration profile within the skin significantly
  affect the surrounding chemical absorption and molecular synthesis. Occluding the
  skin causes water to accumulate in the top layer of the skin (the stratum corneum
  [SC]) and also affects the water diffusivity. Scar treatments such as silicone gel
  and silicone sheets make use of occlusion to increase skin hydration. However with
  existing techniques, it is not possible to quantitatively measure the diffusivity
  of the water during occlusion: current methods determine water diffusivity by measuring
  the water evaporated through the skin and thus require the skin to breathe. In this
  work, we use the high sensitivity of terahertz light to water to study how the water
  content in the SC changes upon occlusion. From our measurements, we can solve the
  diffusion equations in the SC to deduce the water concentration profile in occluded
  skin and subsequently to determine the diffusivity. To our knowledge, this is the
  first work showing how the diffusivity of human skin can be measured during occlusion
  and we envisage this paper as being used as a guide for non-invasively determining
  the diffusivity of occluded human skin in vivo.'
