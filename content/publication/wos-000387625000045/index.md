abstract: Using a spatially structured, optical pump pulse with a terahertz (THz)
  probe pulse, we are able to determine spatial variations of the ultrafast THz photoconductivity
  with subwavelength resolution (75 mu m approximate to lambda/5 at 0.8 THz) in a
  planar graphene sample. We compare our results to Raman spectroscopy and correlate
  the existence of the spatial inhomogeneities between the two measurements. We find
  a strong correlation with inhomogeneity in electron density. This demonstrates the
  importance of eliminating inhomogeneities in doping density during CVD growth and
  fabrication for photoconductive devices.
