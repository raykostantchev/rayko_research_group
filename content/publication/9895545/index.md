abstract: In this work, we use THz spectroscopic measurements in a reflection set-up
  to evaluate the response of the skin to the application of woven and PET film backed
  patches, showing the dynamics of the hydration levels of the areas covered by both
  patches. The results demonstrate that areas covered by the PET film patches were
  strongly affected for longer than 4hrs whilst the application of the woven patches
  allowed for the skin to recover to its original hydration within 30 minutes of patch
  removal.
