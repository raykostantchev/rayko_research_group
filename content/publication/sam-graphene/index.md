abstract: 'Using a spatially structured, optical pump pulse with a terahertz (THz)
  probe pulse, we are able to determine spatial variations of the ultrafast THz photoconductivity
  with subwavelength resolution (75 $μ$m ≈ $łambda$/5 at 0.8 THz) in a planar graphene
  sample. We compare our results to Raman spectroscopy and correlate the existence
  of the spatial inhomogeneities between the two measurements. We find a strong correlation
  with inhomogeneity in electron density. This demonstrates the importance of eliminating
  inhomogeneities in doping density during CVD growth and fabrication for photoconductive
  devices. T he unique optoelectronic properties of graphene have received a lot of
  attention. 1 For example, ultrafast carrier relaxation, 2−6 highly tunable doping
  levels, 7 theoretical mobilities in excess of 150 000 cm 2 V −1 s −1 , 7 and high
  thermal conductivity 8 all lend themselves to a number of interesting device applications.
  However, the large scale manufacturing of this 2D material, usually through chemical
  vapor deposition (CVD), is not yet perfected, and it is well-established that there
  are a number of sources of quality degrading, spatial inhomogeneities such as charge
  puddles, grain boundaries, substrate-induced strain variations, surface impurities,
  periodic nanoripples, multilayer nucleation sites, and fabrication residues. 9−13
  Raman spectroscopy and imaging has emerged as an important characterization tool,
  due to its sensitivity to layer number, 14 strain, 12 carrier concentration, 15
  and de-fects. 16−19 However, the photoconductivity, a critical quantity for many
  optoelectronic applications including photodetec-tors, 20,21 cannot be explicitly
  determined directly in Raman due to the limited number of observable quantities.
  Given its relevance to many optoelectronic applications of graphene, evaluation
  of the ultrafast photoconductivity from optical-pump THz-probe spectroscopy has
  attracted consid-erable interest in the literature in recent years. However, a consensus
  is yet to be reached regarding the origin and nature of the ultrafast photoconductive
  response of graphene, with a number of recent papers 22−29 contributing to the debate.
  These contain a number of competing descriptions, each explaining some of the observed
  features as arising from a competition between stimulated emission and induced absorption,
  22 or through a competition between photoinduced changes in the chemical potential,
  mobility, and carrier relaxation described using thermodynamic, 23,24 a modified
  Drude, 25,26 or micro-scopic 27 models. Some very recent work 28,29 suggests that
  plasmon emission may also contribute. Despite all of this work, the role of spatial
  inhomogeneities has not been discussed in literature to date: due to the large THz
  spot sizes (≈ mm) used in these experiments, they typically provide spatially averaged
  information and are therefore ignorant of the small spatial inhomogeneities typical
  in CVD graphene. In this study, we introduce a technique able to directly image
  how these spatial inhomogeneities affect the local, photo-conductive THz response
  of graphene. This is achieved via spatial patterning of the optical pump beam, allowing
  us to selectively sample our graphene, and thereby building a THz photoconductivity
  map of our CVD graphene sample (supplied by graphenesupermarket.com using a CVD
  copper growth technique 30 and PMMA assisted transfer 31,32). We compare the spatially
  dependent THz photoconductivity to Raman spectral maps and find there to be various
  correlated features. We find that small regions of graphene with low electron density
  display a strongly suppressed photoconductivity on ultrafast time scales. Since
  the resolution of our measurement is determined by the patterned optical pump pulse,
  we are able to observe these small regions of suppressed THz photoconductivity on
  markedly subwavelength length scales (75 $μ$m ≈ $łambda$/5 at 0.8 THz). We use an
  amplified femtosecond laser system (800 nm, 1 kHz repetition rate, ∼100 fs) to generate
  and detect our THz probe beam in a pair of ZnTe crystals through optical rectification
  33 and balanced electro-optic sampling, 33 respec-tively. This allows us to determine
  the electric field, E, of a single cycle THz pulse (central frequency ∼0.8 THz,
