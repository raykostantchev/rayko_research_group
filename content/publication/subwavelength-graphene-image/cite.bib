 abstract = {Using a spatially structured, optical pump pulse with a terahertz (THz)
probe pulse, we are able to determine spatial variations of the
ultrafast THz photoconductivity with subwavelength resolution (75 mu m
approximate to lambda/5 at 0.8 THz) in a planar graphene sample. We
compare our results to Raman spectroscopy and correlate the existence of
the spatial inhomogeneities between the two measurements. We find a
strong correlation with inhomogeneity in electron density. This
demonstrates the importance of eliminating inhomogeneities in doping
density during CVD growth and fabrication for photoconductive devices.},
