 abstract = {The subject of latex film formation has been studied for many years and it is known to be affected by many environmental conditions such as evaporation rate, polymer glass transition temperature, T $_퐠$, and particle size. Understanding latex film formation is particularly relevant to the paint industry, to ensure even coated films. In this study, THz-TDS was used to analyze various latex solutions with different polymer glass transition temperatures and particle sizes. 2D water distribution maps were produced, as a function of drying time, to monitor latex drying processes such as the ‘coffee-ring effect’.},
