abstract: The subject of latex film formation has been studied for many years and
  it is known to be affected by many environmental conditions such as evaporation
  rate, polymer glass transition temperature, T $_퐠$, and particle size. Understanding
  latex film formation is particularly relevant to the paint industry, to ensure even
  coated films. In this study, THz-TDS was used to analyze various latex solutions
  with different polymer glass transition temperatures and particle sizes. 2D water
  distribution maps were produced, as a function of drying time, to monitor latex
  drying processes such as the ‘coffee-ring effect’.
