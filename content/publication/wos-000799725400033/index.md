abstract: Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) has shown promise in biomedical
  sample characterization and high characterization sensitivity is in demand due to
  the thin-film (TF) feature of the sample. This paper proposes an optimized multilayer
  structure for sensitive characterization of TF aqueous solutions in reflection THz-TDS.
  Theoretical simulations are conducted for structural optimization and the 75 mu
  m window-sample-mirror structure displays the best sensitivity compared to other
  sandwich structures and traditional THz measurement geometries. 0-20% TF glucose
  solutions are then measured; and a spectral peak introduced by the proposed structure
  is observed to result in the high sensitivity. Our work provides a new way of customizing
  multilayer structure for THz thin-film characterization. Published by Optica Publishing
