 abstract = {Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) has shown promise in
biomedical sample characterization and high characterization sensitivity
is in demand due to the thin-film (TF) feature of the sample. This paper
proposes an optimized multilayer structure for sensitive
characterization of TF aqueous solutions in reflection THz-TDS.
Theoretical simulations are conducted for structural optimization and
the 75 mu m window-sample-mirror structure displays the best sensitivity
compared to other sandwich structures and traditional THz measurement
geometries. 0-20% TF glucose solutions are then measured; and a
spectral peak introduced by the proposed structure is observed to result
in the high sensitivity. Our work provides a new way of customizing
multilayer structure for THz thin-film characterization. Published by
