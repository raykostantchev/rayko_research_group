 abstract = {Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) has shown promise in biomedical sample characterization and high characterization sensitivity is in demand due to the thin-film (TF) feature of the sample. This paper proposes an optimized multilayer structure for sensitive characterization of TF aqueous solutions in reflection THz-TDS. Theoretical simulations are conducted for structural optimization and the 75 mu m window-sample-mirror structure displays the best sensitivity compared to other sandwich structures and traditional THz measurement geometries. 0-20% TF glucose solutions are then measured; and a spectral peak introduced by the proposed structure is observed to result in the high sensitivity. Our work provides a new way of customizing multilayer structure for THz thin-film characterization.
