 abstract = {It was first suggested that terahertz imaging has the potential to
detect skin cancer twenty years ago. Since then, THz instrumentation has
improved significantly: real time broadband THz imaging is now possible
and robust protocols for measuring living subjects have been developed.
Here, we discuss the progress that has been made as well as highlight
the remaining challenges for applying THz imaging to skin cancer
detection.},
