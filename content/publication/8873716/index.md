abstract: For commercial acceptance, THz technology needs cheaper, more robust and
  quicker imaging modalities that do not sacrifice the time-resolving capabilities
  of THz-TDS systems. Single-pixel detectors with spatial light modulation imaging
  techniques offer a path to rapid, cheap and no-moving parts imaging systems. Here,
  by imaging in this modality, where we use a photoconductive antenna and a THz spatial
  modulator based on tailoring a semiconductor's Drude plasma frequency by spatial
  photoexcitation, we optimize this process by considering the modulation geometry.
  Finally, by considering the system's temporal response in post-processing, we show
  that one can reach a mask modulation rate of 20kHz, only limited by the digital
  micromirror (DMD) switch speeds.
