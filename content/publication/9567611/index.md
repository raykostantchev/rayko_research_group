abstract: We propose our own convolutional neural network (CNN) structure as a post-processing
  method for the rapid THz Imaging in Terahertz Time Domain Spectroscopy(THz-TDS).
  The experiment results show that our approach can greatly reduce the noise and artifacts
  in the collected under-sampled THz images, which in turn benefits the rapid THz
  imaging technique by allowing higher acquisition rates. In our setup, 5 times higher
  acquisition rates can be realized. Moreover, this approach needs no extra hardware
  cost, and since the training has been done offline, the processing time in practice
  can be ignored. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time applying deep
  learning(DL) methods into rapid THz imaging technique, which would inspire researchers
  to explore more DL based applications and technologies for THz technique development.
