abstract: Â© 2020 Author(s). As an essential processing step in many disciplines, signal
  denoising efficiently improves data quality without extra cost. However, it is relatively
  under-utilized for terahertz spectroscopy. The major technique reported uses wavelet
  denoising in the time-domain, which has a fuzzy physical meaning and limited performance
  in low-frequency and water-vapor regions. Here, we work from a new perspective by
  reconstructing the transfer function to remove noise-induced oscillations. The method
  is fully objective without a need for defining a threshold. Both reflection imaging
  and transmission imaging were conducted. The experimental results show that both
  low- and high-frequency noise and the water-vapor influence were efficiently removed.
  The spectrum accuracy was also improved, and the image contrast was significantly
  enhanced. The signal-to-noise ratio of the leaf image was increased up to 10 dB,
  with the 6 dB bandwidth being extended by over 0.5 THz.
