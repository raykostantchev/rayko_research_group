abstract: Terahertz (THz) spectroscopy is a technique proving extremely useful for
  investigating various biomedical applications by virtue of its high sensitivity
  in the measurement of water content and non-ionizing nature. By combining this with
  sparse deconvolution, the THz response of skin directly underneath transdermal drug
  delivery (TDD) patches was isolated and reconstructed to determine the skin water
  content in vivo. Verification for this method was given by a comparison of skin
  measured through patches using sparse deconvolution, and skin measurements immediately
  following patch removal processed with standard approaches. It was found that patches
  with a non-permeable film backing hydrated the skin to a greater extent than permeable
  woven polyester fiber backed patches and that this hydration effect primarily occurs
  within the first 30 minutes of patch application and lasts for at least 24 hours
  given that the patch remains applied. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this sparse
  reconstruction method to track hydration levels through layers such as patches and
  identify scope for further applications including TDD patch development and wound
  healing techniques and monitoring.
