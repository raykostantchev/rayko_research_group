 abstract = {To promote potential applications of terahertz (THz) technology, more
advanced functional THz devices with high performance are needed,
including modulators, polarizers, lenses, wave retarders, and
antireflection coatings. This work summarizes recent progress in THz
components built on functional materials including graphene, vanadium
dioxide, and metamaterials. The key message is that, while the choice of
materials used in such devices is important, the geometry in which they
are employed also has a significant effect on the performance achieved.
In particular, devices operating in total internal reflection geometry
are reviewed, and it is explained how this geometry is able to be
exploited to achieve a variety of THz devices with broadband operation.},
