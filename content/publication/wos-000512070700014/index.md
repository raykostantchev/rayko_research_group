abstract: To promote potential applications of terahertz (THz) technology, more advanced
  functional THz devices with high performance are needed, including modulators, polarizers,
  lenses, wave retarders, and antireflection coatings. This work summarizes recent
  progress in THz components built on functional materials including graphene, vanadium
  dioxide, and metamaterials. The key message is that, while the choice of materials
  used in such devices is important, the geometry in which they are employed also
  has a significant effect on the performance achieved. In particular, devices operating
  in total internal reflection geometry are reviewed, and it is explained how this
  geometry is able to be exploited to achieve a variety of THz devices with broadband
  operation.
