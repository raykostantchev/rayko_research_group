abstract: 'It was first suggested that terahertz imaging has the potential to detect
  skin cancer twenty years ago. Since then, THz instrumentation has improved significantly:
  real time broadband THz imaging is now possible and robust protocols for measuring
  living subjects have been developed. Here, we discuss the progress that has been
  made as well as highlight the remaining challenges for applying THz imaging to skin
  cancer detection.'
