abstract: We demonstrate a form of near-field terahertz (THz) imaging that is compatible
  with compressed sensing algorithms. By spatially photomodulating THz pulses using
  a set of shaped binary optical patterns and employing a 6-&#x03BC;m-thick silicon
  wafer, we are able to reconstruct THz images of an object placed on the exit interface
  of the wafer. A single-element detector is used to measure the electric field amplitude
  of transmitted THz radiation for each projected pattern, with the ultra-thin wafer
  allowing us to access the THz evanescent near fields to achieve a spatial resolution
  of &#x223C;9&#x2009;&#x2009;&#x03BC;m (&#x03BB;/45 at 0.75&#x00A0;THz). We conclude
  by experimentally improving the image rate by a factor of &#x223C;3 by undersampling
  the object with adaptive and compressed sensing algorithms.
