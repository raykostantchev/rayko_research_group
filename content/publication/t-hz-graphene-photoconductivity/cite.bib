 abstract = {© 2016 American Chemical Society. Using a spatially structured, optical pump pulse with a terahertz (THz) probe pulse, we are able to determine spatial variations of the ultrafast THz photoconductivity with subwavelength resolution (75 $μ$m /5 at 0.8 THz) in a planar graphene sample. We compare our results to Raman spectroscopy and correlate the existence of the spatial inhomogeneities between the two measurements. We find a strong correlation with inhomogeneity in electron density. This demonstrates the importance of eliminating inhomogeneities in doping density during CVD growth and fabrication for photoconductive devices.},
