abstract: © 2016 American Chemical Society. Using a spatially structured, optical
  pump pulse with a terahertz (THz) probe pulse, we are able to determine spatial
  variations of the ultrafast THz photoconductivity with subwavelength resolution
  (75 $μ$m /5 at 0.8 THz) in a planar graphene sample. We compare our results to Raman
  spectroscopy and correlate the existence of the spatial inhomogeneities between
  the two measurements. We find a strong correlation with inhomogeneity in electron
  density. This demonstrates the importance of eliminating inhomogeneities in doping
  density during CVD growth and fabrication for photoconductive devices.
