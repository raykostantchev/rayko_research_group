abstract: We propose a new method for detecting small defects on the surface of a
  semiconductor by analyzing the transmission spectrum of terahertz surface plasmon
  polaritons. The field distributions caused by the detection of defects of different
  sizes are simulated. Experimentally, using a terahertz time domain spectrometer,
  we measure the transmission spectrum of terahertz surface plasmon polaritons passing
  through particles on the surface of an intrinsic InSb wafer. Our results show that
  the measured temporal waveform and frequency spectra are distinctly changed due
  to the presence of the particles, thereby confirming the effectiveness of this method
  for detecting defects. For increased detection efficiency, the frequency of the
  surface plasmon polaritons has to be slightly lower than the plasma frequency of
  the semiconductor. In comparison with traditional methods, our approach offers the
  merits of detecting both on-surface and subsurface defects, which is critical in
  monitoring the quality of semiconductor wafers. (C) 2016 Optical Society of America
