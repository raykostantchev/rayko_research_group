 abstract = {We propose a new method for detecting small defects on the surface of a
semiconductor by analyzing the transmission spectrum of terahertz
surface plasmon polaritons. The field distributions caused by the
detection of defects of different sizes are simulated. Experimentally,
using a terahertz time domain spectrometer, we measure the transmission
spectrum of terahertz surface plasmon polaritons passing through
particles on the surface of an intrinsic InSb wafer. Our results show
that the measured temporal waveform and frequency spectra are distinctly
changed due to the presence of the particles, thereby confirming the
effectiveness of this method for detecting defects. For increased
detection efficiency, the frequency of the surface plasmon polaritons
has to be slightly lower than the plasma frequency of the semiconductor.
In comparison with traditional methods, our approach offers the merits
of detecting both on-surface and subsurface defects, which is critical
in monitoring the quality of semiconductor wafers. (C) 2016 Optical
