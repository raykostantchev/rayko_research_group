abstract: THz has shown that it can be used for non-invasive skin measurements, successfully
  identifying many skin diseases. These measurements have typically been performed
  with pulsed time-domain THz sources, however there is no study that compares if
  a frequency domain measurement is better or worse. Here, we compare the ability
  to extract the skinâ€™s refractive index and hydration levels using a pulsed-THz photoconductive
  antenna and a CW-THz photomixer.
