 abstract = {THz has shown that it can be used for non-invasive skin measurements, successfully identifying many skin diseases. These measurements have typically been performed with pulsed time-domain THz sources, however there is no study that compares if a frequency domain measurement is better or worse. Here, we compare the ability to extract the skinâ€™s refractive index and hydration levels using a pulsed-THz photoconductive antenna and a CW-THz photomixer.},
