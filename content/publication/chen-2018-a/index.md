abstract: Terahertz modulators with high tunability of both intensity and phase are
  essential for effective control of electromagnetic properties. Due to the underlying
  physics behind existing approaches there is still a lack of broadband devices able
  to achieve deep modulation. Here, we demonstrate the effect of tunable Brewster
  angle controlled by graphene, and develop a highly-tunable solid-state graphene/quartz
  modulator based on this mechanism. The Brewster angle of the device can be tuned
  by varying the conductivity of the graphene through an electrical gate. In this
  way, we achieve near perfect intensity modulation with spectrally flat modulation
  depth of 99.3 to 99.9 percent and phase tunability of up to 140 degree in the frequency
  range from 0.5 to 1.6 THz. Different from using electromagnetic resonance effects
  (for example, metamaterials), this principle ensures that our device can operate
  in ultra-broadband. Thus it is an effective principle for terahertz modulation.
