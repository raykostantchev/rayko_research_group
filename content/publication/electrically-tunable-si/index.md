abstract: Silicon-based terahertz (THz) photomodulators suffer from a modulation speed
  limited by the lifetime of the charge carriers photoexcited in the silicon. We report
  a silicon-based THz photomodulator scheme offering real-time reconfiguration of
  the switching behavior by manipulation of effective charge carrier lifetime. Atomic
  layer deposition was used to coat silicon samples with dielectric layers to passivate
  the surfaces with a conductive polymer subsequently deposited to enable electrical
  gating over the whole surface. The resulting gated photomodulators are characterized
  using photoconductance decay and photoluminescence imaging. A gated photomodulator
  with HfO2 passivation is then implemented into a THz time domain spectroscopy setup
  to demonstrate the potential for live photomodulation optimization during a single-pixel
  imaging experiment. We use the device to achieve a real-time improvement of the
  signal-to-noise ratio of the images by a factor of 8.
