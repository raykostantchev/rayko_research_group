 abstract = {We employed a metallic wire grating loaded with graphene and operating
in total internal reflection (TIR) geometry to realize deep and
broadband THz modulation. The non-resonant field enhancement effect of
the evanescent wave in TIR geometry and in the subwavelength wire
grating was combined to demonstrate a similar to 77% modulation depth
(MD) in the frequency range of 0.2-1.4 THz. This MD, achieved
electrically with a SiO2/Si gated graphene device, was 4.5 times higher
than that of the device without a metal grating in transmission
geometry. By optimizing the parameters of the metallic wire grating, the
required sheet conductivity of graphene for deep modulation was lowered
to 0.87 mS. This work has potential applications in THz communication
and real-time THz imaging. (C) 2018 Chinese Laser Press},
