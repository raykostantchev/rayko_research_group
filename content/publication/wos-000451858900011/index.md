abstract: We employed a metallic wire grating loaded with graphene and operating in
  total internal reflection (TIR) geometry to realize deep and broadband THz modulation.
  The non-resonant field enhancement effect of the evanescent wave in TIR geometry
  and in the subwavelength wire grating was combined to demonstrate a similar to 77%
  modulation depth (MD) in the frequency range of 0.2-1.4 THz. This MD, achieved electrically
  with a SiO2/Si gated graphene device, was 4.5 times higher than that of the device
  without a metal grating in transmission geometry. By optimizing the parameters of
  the metallic wire grating, the required sheet conductivity of graphene for deep
  modulation was lowered to 0.87 mS. This work has potential applications in THz communication
  and real-time THz imaging. (C) 2018 Chinese Laser Press
