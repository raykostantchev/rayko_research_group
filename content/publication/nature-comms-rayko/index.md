abstract: Terahertz (THz) radiation is poised to have an essential role in many imaging
  applications, from industrial inspections to medical diagnosis. However, commercialization
  is prevented by impractical and expensive THz instrumentation. Single-pixel cameras
  have emerged as alternatives to multi-pixel cameras due to reduced costs and superior
  durability. Here, by optimizing the modulation geometry and post-processing algorithms,
  we demonstrate the acquisition of a THz-video (32 x 32 pixels at 6 frames-per-second),
  shown in real-time, using a single-pixel fiber-coupled photoconductive THz detector.
  A laser diode with a digital micromirror device shining visible light onto silicon
  acts as the spatial THz modulator. We mathematically account for the temporal response
  of the system, reduce noise with a lock-in free carrier-wave modulation and realize
  quick, noise-robust image undersampling. Since our modifications do not impose intricate
  manufacturing, require long post-processing, nor sacrifice the time-resolving capabilities
  of THz-spectrometers, their greatest asset, this work has the potential to serve
  as a foundation for all future single-pixel THz imaging systems. Terahertz imaging
  is promising in many applications, but still relies on complex equipment. Here,
  the authors develop a simplified solution that enables terahertz real-time imaging
  using a single-pixel detector and rapid reconstruction methods.
