 abstract = {Terahertz (THz) radiation is poised to have an essential role in many
imaging applications, from industrial inspections to medical diagnosis.
However, commercialization is prevented by impractical and expensive THz
instrumentation. Single-pixel cameras have emerged as alternatives to
multi-pixel cameras due to reduced costs and superior durability. Here,
by optimizing the modulation geometry and post-processing algorithms, we
demonstrate the acquisition of a THz-video (32 x 32 pixels at 6
frames-per-second), shown in real-time, using a single-pixel
fiber-coupled photoconductive THz detector. A laser diode with a digital
micromirror device shining visible light onto silicon acts as the
spatial THz modulator. We mathematically account for the temporal
response of the system, reduce noise with a lock-in free carrier-wave
modulation and realize quick, noise-robust image undersampling. Since
our modifications do not impose intricate manufacturing, require long
post-processing, nor sacrifice the time-resolving capabilities of
THz-spectrometers, their greatest asset, this work has the potential to
serve as a foundation for all future single-pixel THz imaging systems.
Terahertz imaging is promising in many applications, but still relies on
complex equipment. Here, the authors develop a simplified solution that
enables terahertz real-time imaging using a single-pixel detector and
rapid reconstruction methods.},
