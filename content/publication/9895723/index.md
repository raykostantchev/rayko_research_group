abstract: Developing a fast and robust THz time-domain imaging system that is low
  cost is essential for future commercial uses of such systems. Single-pixel imaging
  techniques are compatible with THz time-domain detectors and the combination of
  being a movement-free imaging system with undersampling capabilities gives them
  the potential of having fast acquisition rates. However, most undersampling algorithms
  have been designed for visible light imaging technology which is very different
  from THz technology. Here, we optimize the equipment and algorithms used for time-domain
  THz single-pixel imaging.
