 abstract = {Optical modulation of terahertz surface plasmon polaritons (THz SPPs)
propagating in an intrinsic indium antimonide surface is demonstrated in
this paper. The modulation is mediated by the modification of free
carrier density with optical illumination. Simulation and experimental
results show that a THz modulator can be realized by tuning the
propagation lengths of THz SPPs, which could be controlled to be larger
or shorter than the distance of two razor blades used for the coupling
of the THz wave and the THz SPPs. In comparison with conventional THz
modulation approaches, this method of manufacturing is simpler and the
switching bandwidth is wider. The maximum modulation frequency of the
modulators is anticipated to be above gigahertz, thus leading to the
possibility of communication applications using the THz baseband. (C)
