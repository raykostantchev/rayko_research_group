abstract: Silicone gel sheeting (SGS) is widely used for scar treatment; however,
  studies showing its interaction with skin and efficacy of scar treatment are still
  lacking. THz light is non-ionizing and highly sensitive to changes in water content
  and thus skin hydration. In this work, we use in-vivo THz imaging to monitor how
  SGS affects the THz response of human skin during occlusion, and the associated
  THz reflectivity and refractive index changes are presented. We find that SGS effectively
  hydrates the skin beneath it, with minimal lateral effects beyond the sheeting.
  Our work demonstrates that THz imaging is able to detect the subtle hydration changes
  on the surface of human skin caused by SGS, and it has the potential to be used
  to evaluate different scar treatment strategies.
