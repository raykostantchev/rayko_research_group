abstract: Potential applications of terahertz (THz) radiation are constantly being
  investigated for high-speed communication due to its large bandwidth. For example,
  frequency hopping communication technology would benefit from the large bandwidth.
  To attach the information to the carrier wave, THz modulators with deep and stable
  modulation at different frequencies are crucial, yet are still lacking. Here a THz
  modulator, designed by integrating a non-resonant field enhancement effect of periodic
  metal microslits to assist a Fabry-Perot resonance structure (MS-FP) is proposed
  and demonstrated. New equations are developed to describe the superior performance
  of the novel design. The >95% modulation depth is achieved by a SiO2/Si gated graphene
  device at 14 Fabry-Perot resonant frequencies across 1.4 THz bandwidth, outperforming
  the recently reported 75% modulation depth THz modulator with a similar Fabry-Perot
  structure. (C) 2021 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access
