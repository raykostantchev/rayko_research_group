 abstract = {Potential applications of terahertz (THz) radiation are constantly being
investigated for high-speed communication due to its large bandwidth.
For example, frequency hopping communication technology would benefit
from the large bandwidth. To attach the information to the carrier wave,
THz modulators with deep and stable modulation at different frequencies
are crucial, yet are still lacking. Here a THz modulator, designed by
integrating a non-resonant field enhancement effect of periodic metal
microslits to assist a Fabry-Perot resonance structure (MS-FP) is
proposed and demonstrated. New equations are developed to describe the
superior performance of the novel design. The >95% modulation depth is
achieved by a SiO2/Si gated graphene device at 14 Fabry-Perot resonant
frequencies across 1.4 THz bandwidth, outperforming the recently
reported 75% modulation depth THz modulator with a similar Fabry-Perot
structure. (C) 2021 Optical Society of America under the terms of the
