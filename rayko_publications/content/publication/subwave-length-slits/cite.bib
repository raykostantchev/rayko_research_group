 abstract = {We present measurements and analytical modeling which demonstrate
enhanced THz transmission through a subwavelength aperture via
light-induced diffraction. Our experiment involves photoexciting a
conducting pattern onto a silicon interface so as to control and
modulate the near-field interference of THz radiation. To illustrate the
concept, we photoexcite a simple double-conducting stripe pattern on the
incident side of a silicon wafer which has a slit etched into a gold
film on the exit side. We show that under certain resonant conditions
set by the stripe dimensions, a constructive near-field interference can
bring about enhanced transmission through the slit. By raster scanning
the excitation pattern under these resonant conditions, one can build an
image of subwavelength features such as the slit aperture of our sample.},
