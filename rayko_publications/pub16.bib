Abstract = {Water diffusion and the concentration profile within the skin
   significantly affect the surrounding chemical absorption and molecular
   synthesis. Occluding the skin causes water to accumulate in the top
   layer of the skin (the stratum corneum {[}SC]) and also affects the
   water diffusivity. Scar treatments such as silicone gel and silicone
   sheets make use of occlusion to increase skin hydration. However with
   existing techniques, it is not possible to quantitatively measure the
   diffusivity of the water during occlusion: current methods determine
   water diffusivity by measuring the water evaporated through the skin and
   thus require the skin to breathe. In this work, we use the high
   sensitivity of terahertz light to water to study how the water content
   in the SC changes upon occlusion. From our measurements, we can solve
   the diffusion equations in the SC to deduce the water concentration
   profile in occluded skin and subsequently to determine the diffusivity.
   To our knowledge, this is the first work showing how the diffusivity of
   human skin can be measured during occlusion and we envisage this paper
   as being used as a guide for non-invasively determining the diffusivity
   of occluded human skin in vivo.},
