  abstract={A compact and easy-to-use terahertz spectrometer is proposed to realize in-situ and fast measurement of both the s- and p- polarizations. A multi-pixel emitter is integrated into a handheld fiber-based terahertz scanner working in a reflection configuration. This self-referenced and mechanical rotation-free ellipsometer will significantly speed up the measurement process and has great potential for use in vivo skin measurements.},
