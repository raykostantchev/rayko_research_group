Abstract = {Terahertz (THz) thin-film total internal reflection (TF-TIR)
   spectroscopy is shown to have an enhanced sensitivity to the vibrational
   properties of thin films in comparison with standard THz transmission
   spectroscopy. This increased sensitivity was used to track photoinduced
   modifications to the structure of thin films of methylammonium (MA) lead
   halide, MAPbI(3-x)Br(x) (x = 0, 0.5, 1, and 3). Initially, illumination
   strengthened the phonon modes around 2 THz, associated with Pb-I stretch
   modes coupled to the MA ions, whereas the 1 THz twist modes of the
   inorganic octahedra did not alter in strength. Under longer term
   illumination, the 1 THz phonon modes of encapsulated films slowly
   reduced in strength, whereas in films exposed to moisture and oxygen,
   these phonons weaken more rapidly and blue-shift in frequency. The rapid
   monitoring of environmentally induced changes to the vibrational modes
   afforded by TF-TIR spectroscopy offers applications in the
   characterization and quality control of the perovskite thin-film solar
   cells and other thin-film semiconductors.},
