  abstract={In this work, we use THz spectroscopic measurements in a reflection set-up to evaluate the response of the skin to the application of woven and PET film backed patches, showing the dynamics of the hydration levels of the areas covered by both patches. The results demonstrate that areas covered by the PET film patches were strongly affected for longer than 4hrs whilst the application of the woven patches allowed for the skin to recover to its original hydration within 30 minutes of patch removal.},
