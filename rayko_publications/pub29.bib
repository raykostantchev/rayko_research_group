Abstract = {We report the first use of a convolutional neural network for terahertz
   (THz) imaging combined with a single-pixel camera to achieve high
   quality hyperspectral THz imaging 10x faster than the current commercial
   systems, with faster potential only limited by noise. Imaging with a
   spatial light modulator (SLM) relies on projecting a set of spatial
   patterns onto an object and recording the transmission with a
   single-pixel detector, and an optical delay unit (ODU) is used to obtain
   the terahertz time-of-flight information. A key breakthrough in this
   work is to synchronize the equipment to not need any time to instruct
   the ODU to move while projecting the patterns.},
