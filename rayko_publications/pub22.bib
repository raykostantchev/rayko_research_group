Abstract = {As an essential processing step in many disciplines, signal denoising
   efficiently improves data quality without extra cost. However, it is
   relatively under-utilized for terahertz spectroscopy. The major
   technique reported uses wavelet denoising in the time-domain, which has
   a fuzzy physical meaning and limited performance in low-frequency and
   water-vapor regions. Here, we work from a new perspective by
   reconstructing the transfer function to remove noise-induced
   oscillations. The method is fully objective without a need for defining
   a threshold. Both reflection imaging and transmission imaging were
   conducted. The experimental results show that both low- and
   high-frequency noise and the water-vapor influence were efficiently
   removed. The spectrum accuracy was also improved, and the image contrast
   was significantly enhanced. The signal-to-noise ratio of the leaf image
   was increased up to 10 dB, with the 6 dB bandwidth being extended by
   over 0.5 THz.},
