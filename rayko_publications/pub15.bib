Abstract = {Terahertz (THz) light is non-ionizing and highly sensitive to subtle
   changes in water concentration which can be indicative of disease. The
   short THz penetration depth in bio-samples restricts in vivo
   measurements to be in a reflection geometry and the sample is often
   placed onto an imaging window. Upon contacting the imaging window,
   occlusion and compression of the skin affect the THz response. If not
   appropriately controlled, this could cause misleading results. In this
   work, we investigate and quantify how the applied pressure affects the
   THz response of skin and employ a stratified model to help understand
   the mechanisms at play. This work will enable future THz studies to have
   a more rigorous experimental protocol, which in turn will facilitate
   research in various potential biomedical applications under
   investigation. (C) 2018 Optical Society of America under the terms of
