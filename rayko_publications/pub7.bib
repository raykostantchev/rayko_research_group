Abstract = {Measurement of the plasma frequency of a semiconductor film using
   broadband surface plasmon is demonstrated in this paper. We
   theoretically deduce a formula about the relation between plasma
   frequency and characteristic surface plasmon frequency. The
   characteristic surface plasmon frequency can be captured from the
   cut-off frequency of the transmission spectra of the broadband surface
   plasmon, which is used to measure the plasma frequency indirectly. The
   plasma frequencies of an intrinsic indium antimonide with and without
   optical illuminance are measured with a THz time-domain spectrometer at
   room temperature. The experimental measured plasma frequencies fit well
   with theoretical and simulation results. Compared with other methods,
   the proposed method has a special advantage on measuring the plasma
   frequency for a thin semiconductor film coated on other materials. (C)
