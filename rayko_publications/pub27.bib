Abstract = {Potential applications of terahertz (THz) radiation are constantly being
   investigated for high-speed communication due to its large bandwidth.
   For example, frequency hopping communication technology would benefit
   from the large bandwidth. To attach the information to the carrier wave,
   THz modulators with deep and stable modulation at different frequencies
   are crucial, yet are still lacking. Here a THz modulator, designed by
   integrating a non-resonant field enhancement effect of periodic metal
   microslits to assist a Fabry-Perot resonance structure (MS-FP) is
   proposed and demonstrated. New equations are developed to describe the
   superior performance of the novel design. The >95\% modulation depth is
   achieved by a SiO2/Si gated graphene device at 14 Fabry-Perot resonant
   frequencies across 1.4 THz bandwidth, outperforming the recently
   reported 75\% modulation depth THz modulator with a similar Fabry-Perot
   structure. (C) 2021 Optical Society of America under the terms of the
