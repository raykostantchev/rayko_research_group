Abstract = {Silicone gel sheeting (SGS) is widely used for scar treatment; however,
   studies showing its interaction with skin and efficacy of scar treatment
   are still lacking. THz light is non-ionizing and highly sensitive to
   changes in Water content and thus skin hydration. In this work, we use
   in-vivo THz imaging to monitor how SGS affects the THz response of human
   skin during occlusion, and the associated THz reflectivity and
   refractive index changes are presented. We find that SGS effectively
   hydrates the skin beneath it, with minimal lateral effects beyond the
   sheeting. Our work demonstrates that THz imaging is able to detect the
   subtle hydration changes on the surface of human skin caused by SGS, and
   it has the potential to be used to evaluate different scar treatment
   strategies. (C) 2019 Optical Society of America under the terms of the
