Abstract = {We present measurements and analytical modeling which demonstrate
   enhanced THz transmission through a subwavelength aperture via
   light-induced diffraction. Our experiment involves photoexciting a
   conducting pattern onto a silicon interface so as to control and
   modulate the near-field interference of THz radiation. To illustrate the
   concept, we photoexcite a simple double-conducting stripe pattern on the
   incident side of a silicon wafer which has a slit etched into a gold
   film on the exit side. We show that under certain resonant conditions
   set by the stripe dimensions, a constructive near-field interference can
   bring about enhanced transmission through the slit. By raster scanning
   the excitation pattern under these resonant conditions, one can build an
   image of subwavelength features such as the slit aperture of our sample.},
