Abstract = {Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) has shown promise in
   biomedical sample characterization and high characterization sensitivity
   is in demand due to the thin-film (TF) feature of the sample. This paper
   proposes an optimized multilayer structure for sensitive
   characterization of TF aqueous solutions in reflection THz-TDS.
   Theoretical simulations are conducted for structural optimization and
   the 75 mu m window-sample-mirror structure displays the best sensitivity
   compared to other sandwich structures and traditional THz measurement
   geometries. 0-20\% TF glucose solutions are then measured; and a
   spectral peak introduced by the proposed structure is observed to result
   in the high sensitivity. Our work provides a new way of customizing
   multilayer structure for THz thin-film characterization. Published by
