Abstract = {We propose a new method for detecting small defects on the surface of a
   semiconductor by analyzing the transmission spectrum of terahertz
   surface plasmon polaritons. The field distributions caused by the
   detection of defects of different sizes are simulated. Experimentally,
   using a terahertz time domain spectrometer, we measure the transmission
   spectrum of terahertz surface plasmon polaritons passing through
   particles on the surface of an intrinsic InSb wafer. Our results show
   that the measured temporal waveform and frequency spectra are distinctly
   changed due to the presence of the particles, thereby confirming the
   effectiveness of this method for detecting defects. For increased
   detection efficiency, the frequency of the surface plasmon polaritons
   has to be slightly lower than the plasma frequency of the semiconductor.
   In comparison with traditional methods, our approach offers the merits
   of detecting both on-surface and subsurface defects, which is critical
   in monitoring the quality of semiconductor wafers. (C) 2016 Optical
