Abstract = {Using a spatially structured, optical pump pulse with a terahertz (THz)
   probe pulse, we are able to determine spatial variations of the
   ultrafast THz photoconductivity with subwavelength resolution (75 mu m
   approximate to lambda/5 at 0.8 THz) in a planar graphene sample. We
   compare our results to Raman spectroscopy and correlate the existence of
   the spatial inhomogeneities between the two measurements. We find a
   strong correlation with inhomogeneity in electron density. This
   demonstrates the importance of eliminating inhomogeneities in doping
   density during CVD growth and fabrication for photoconductive devices.},
