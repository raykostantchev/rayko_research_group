Abstract = {To promote potential applications of terahertz (THz) technology, more
   advanced functional THz devices with high performance are needed,
   including modulators, polarizers, lenses, wave retarders, and
   antireflection coatings. This work summarizes recent progress in THz
   components built on functional materials including graphene, vanadium
   dioxide, and metamaterials. The key message is that, while the choice of
   materials used in such devices is important, the geometry in which they
   are employed also has a significant effect on the performance achieved.
   In particular, devices operating in total internal reflection geometry
   are reviewed, and it is explained how this geometry is able to be
   exploited to achieve a variety of THz devices with broadband operation.},
