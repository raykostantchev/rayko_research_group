Abstract = {Terahertz (THz) radiation is poised to have an essential role in many
   imaging applications, from industrial inspections to medical diagnosis.
   However, commercialization is prevented by impractical and expensive THz
   instrumentation. Single-pixel cameras have emerged as alternatives to
   multi-pixel cameras due to reduced costs and superior durability. Here,
   by optimizing the modulation geometry and post-processing algorithms, we
   demonstrate the acquisition of a THz-video (32 x 32 pixels at 6
   frames-per-second), shown in real-time, using a single-pixel
   fiber-coupled photoconductive THz detector. A laser diode with a digital
   micromirror device shining visible light onto silicon acts as the
   spatial THz modulator. We mathematically account for the temporal
   response of the system, reduce noise with a lock-in free carrier-wave
   modulation and realize quick, noise-robust image undersampling. Since
   our modifications do not impose intricate manufacturing, require long
   post-processing, nor sacrifice the time-resolving capabilities of
   THz-spectrometers, their greatest asset, this work has the potential to
   serve as a foundation for all future single-pixel THz imaging systems.
   Terahertz imaging is promising in many applications, but still relies on
   complex equipment. Here, the authors develop a simplified solution that
   enables terahertz real-time imaging using a single-pixel detector and
   rapid reconstruction methods.},
