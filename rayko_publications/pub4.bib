Abstract = {Optical modulation of terahertz surface plasmon polaritons (THz SPPs)
   propagating in an intrinsic indium antimonide surface is demonstrated in
   this paper. The modulation is mediated by the modification of free
   carrier density with optical illumination. Simulation and experimental
   results show that a THz modulator can be realized by tuning the
   propagation lengths of THz SPPs, which could be controlled to be larger
   or shorter than the distance of two razor blades used for the coupling
   of the THz wave and the THz SPPs. In comparison with conventional THz
   modulation approaches, this method of manufacturing is simpler and the
   switching bandwidth is wider. The maximum modulation frequency of the
   modulators is anticipated to be above gigahertz, thus leading to the
   possibility of communication applications using the THz baseband. (C)
