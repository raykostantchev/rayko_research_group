Abstract = {Single pixel imaging (SPI) captures images without array detectors or
   raster scanning. When combined with compressive sensing techniques it
   enables novel solutions for high-speed optical imaging and spectroscopy.
   However, when it comes to the real-time capture and analysis of a fast
   event, the challenge is the inherent trade-off between frame rate and
   image resolution. Due to the lack of sufficient sparsity and the
   intrinsic iterative process, conventional compressed sensing techniques
   have limited improvement in capturing natural scenes and displaying the
   images in real time. In this work, we demonstrate a novel alternative
   compressive imaging approach employing an efficient and
   easy-implementation sampling scheme based on reordering the
   deterministic Hadamard basis through their total variation. By this
   means, the number of measurements and acquisition are reduced
   significantly without needing complex minimization algorithms. We can
   recover a 128x128 image with a sampling ratio of 5\% at the signal peak
   signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 23.8dB, achieving super sub-Nyquist
   sampling SPI. Compared to other widely used sampling e.g. standard
   Hadamard protocols and Gaussian matrix methods, this approach results in
   a significant improvement both in the compression ratio and image
   reconstruction quality, enabling SPI for high frame rate imaging or
   video applications.},
