Abstract = {Recently, finite rate of innovation methods have been successfully
   applied to achieve low sampling rates in many areas, such as for
   ultrasound and radio signals. However, to the best of our knowledge,
   there are no journal publications applying this to real terahertz
   signals. In this work, we mathematically describe a finite rate of
   innovation method applied specifically to terahertz signals both
   experimentally and in simulation. To demonstrate our method, we applied
   it to randomized simulated signals with and without the presence of
   noise and to simple experimental measurements. We found excellent
   agreement between the simulated signals and those recreated based on
   results from our method, with this success also being replicated
   experimentally. These results were obtained at relatively low sampling
   rates, compared to standard methods, which is a key advantage to using a
   finite rate of innovation method as it allows for faster data
   acquisition and signal processing.},
