Abstract = {It was first suggested that terahertz imaging has the potential to
   detect skin cancer twenty years ago. Since then, THz instrumentation has
   improved significantly: real time broadband THz imaging is now possible
   and robust protocols for measuring living subjects have been developed.
   Here, we discuss the progress that has been made as well as highlight
   the remaining challenges for applying THz imaging to skin cancer
   detection.},
